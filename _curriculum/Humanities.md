<h4><strong>KEY PROGRAMMES</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Humanities: Teaching and Learning</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Clementi Town Secondary School, we believe that our teachers’ main
role in class is to be facilitators in our students’ pursuit for content
and conceptual understanding. Our lessons are centered on the main pedagogical
approach of Inquiry Based Learning, where our Clementeens become co-constructors
of the knowledge covered in class by engaging in discussions and studying
authentic and relevant sources. Coupled with the use of relevant ICT tools
which connect our Clementeens to the world out there, we aim to develop
critical learners and future-ready Clementeens by bringing education beyond
the confines of the classroom.</p>
<p><strong>Social Studies: Entrepreneurship Programme for Sec 3 Normal Technical Social Studies</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Humanities Department conceptualized an experiential learning entrepreneurship
programme for Secondary 3NT students. This programme focuses on learning
to be student-centered, purposeful and informal. Students were given the
opportunity to apply their learning from Humanities lessons (Social Studies
and Elements of Business Skills) through the planning and executing of
a student-run business. Furthermore, as the programme links to the school’s
VIA program, students were given the opportunity to reflect and enforce
on certain character values such as empathy and compassion. As the students
prepare to run a Bazaar at the end of Term 3, Teachers serve not as content
deliverers but as facilitators for students to grasp concepts through the
act of doing.</p>
<p>We believe strongly that the provision of an authentic learning environment
incorporating meaningful learning experiences will enhance and make the
learning of Financial Literacy more palatable to meet the interests, profile
and needs of our Secondary 3NT Pupils.</p>
<p><strong>History: Historical Investigations</strong>
</p>
<p>To enhance our Clementeens’ learning, Secondary 1 and 2 Clementeens were
given the opportunity to embark on historical investigations that revolved
around the concept of conflict. Over the years, our Secondary Two Clementeens
were given the opportunity to embark on customized trails around key World
War II sites such as Kranji War Memorial and Fort Factory. In 2019, Clementeens
were given the opportunity to explore Fort Siloso as part of their Historical
Investigations.&nbsp; They were able to learn more about Singapore’s darkest
moments through the trails which our department teachers have specially
crafted for them.&nbsp; Given the current COVID situation, our teachers
tapped on online platforms and created an online trail that mimicked the
actual journey that they would have taken had they been able to embark
on a physical trail. This helps to ensure that learning continues to be
vibrant and engaging despite the current limitations that we face.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Geography: Geographical Investigations</strong>
</p>
<p>Our choice of Geographical Investigation approach is by offering students
choices in fieldwork. This form of inquiry-based learning allows students
to engage proactively in their own investigation where the role of the
teacher is of a facilitator in the classroom and at the field. Students
were given the autonomy to decide on their hypothesis and were empowered
to select their tools and methods of investigation. Figure 1 shows the
GI process that the teachers had designed, aimed at driving students’ intrinsic
learning motivation as they get to investigate an issue/ problem that interests
them.</p>

<p><em>“I like how we are given the freedom to choose what we can investigate. It’s fun! At least I know what I am doing and why and how we are doing it.”</em>

<p><strong>Singapore Footprints</strong>
</p>
<p>The Singapore Footprints is a heritage trail based on the concept of an
amazing race around prominent neighborhoods around Singapore which has
evolved since 2006. It has in recent years, incorporated the use of Smart
phones to leverage on ICT to engage and excite students in learning about
the rich history and heritage of different locations in Singapore. Through
these trails, students get to learn more about the rich history of neighborhoods
like Clementi, Queenstown and Jurong.</p>
<p>Students will also get to understand the importance of conservation. From
the sites visited, they will understand the possible constraints faced
during conservation, and also how conservation involves not just simply
the preservation of the building structure, but also reintegrating the
site for current use to maintain its relevance. Through comprehending the
process of conservation, it instills in students a sense of pride and commitment
to their living environments and hopefully ignites in them a passion to
be stewards of our heritage.</p>
<p><strong>Immersion Trip to Liaoning, China, 2019</strong>
</p>
<p>Last November, a group of selected Secondary 2 and 3 CTSS students went
to Liaoning, China to deepen their understanding of the Humanities subjects
while experiencing a different culture and learning beyond the classroom
by visiting sites of Geographical and Historical significance. Our students
went to visit a local Secondary school in Shenyang, which helped them to
see how learning takes place in another country. Many of our students marveled
at the discipline displayed by the students there as well as at the facilities
in the school. We also had the opportunity to travel using the local High
Speed Railway, which was a new experience for most of us.</p>
<p>Other places of interest that we visited were the Benxi Water Caves Museum,
which contained rare dinosaur fossils and various precious crystals. We
also visited the Dalian Coastal Geo-park, which is really a wonder of nature.
There, students were able to see naturally formed geological structures
in one of nature’s most scenic settings. We also had the rare privilege
of getting as close to North Korea as we possibly could when we visited
two sites; the Broken Bridge Site and the Hushan Great Wall</p>
<p>The Broken Bridge Site at the Yalu River in Dandong used to connect China
to North Korea but was later damaged during the Korean War by United Nations
troops. Today this Bridge is a living historical site where actual battles
took place. The second site was the Hushan Great Wall where one side of
the wall overlooks China and the other side overlooks North Korea. It was
surreal to witness how starkly the two views contrasted.</p>
<p>Another site that left an indelible impression was the September 18th&nbsp;History
Museum which commemorated the spirit shown by the Chinese people during
the Second Sino-Japanese War and as a reminder of the atrocities that the
people then had to suffer.</p>
