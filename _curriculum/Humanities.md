<h4><strong>Signature Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Humanities: Teaching and Learning</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Clementi Town Secondary School, we believe that our teachers’ main
role in class is to be facilitators in our students’ pursuit for content
and conceptual understanding. Our lessons are centered on the main pedagogical
approach of <strong>Experiential Learning through Inquiry</strong>, where
our Clementeens become co-constructors of the knowledge covered in class
by engaging in discussions and studying authentic and relevant sources.
Coupled with the use of relevant ICT tools which connect our Clementeens
to the world out there, we aim to develop critical learners and future-ready
Clementeens by bringing education beyond the confines of the classroom.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Historical Investigation through Museum Based Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>To enhance our Clementeens’ learning, Secondary 1 and 2 Clementeens were
given the opportunity to embark on historical investigations that revolved
around the concept of conflict. Over the years, our Secondary Two Clementeens
were given the opportunity to embark on customized trails around key&nbsp;World
War II sites such as Kranji War Memorial and Fort Factory. In 2019, Clementeens
were given the opportunity to explore&nbsp;Fort Siloso as part of their
Historical Investigations.&nbsp; They were able to learn more about Singapore’s
darkest moments through the trails which our department teachers have specially
crafted for them.&nbsp; Given the current COVID situation, our teachers
tapped on online platforms and created an online trail that mimicked the
actual journey that they would have taken had they been able to embark
on a physical trail. This helps to ensure that learning continues to be
vibrant and engaging despite the current limitations that we face.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Geography: Geographical Investigations</strong>
</p>
<p>Our choice of Geographical Investigation approach is by offering Clementeens
choices in fieldwork. This form of inquiry-based learning allows Clementeens
to engage proactively in their own investigation where the role of the
teacher is of a facilitator in the classroom and at the field. Clementeens
were given the autonomy to decide on their hypothesis and were empowered
to select their tools and methods of investigation. Figure 1 shows the
GI process that the teachers had designed, aimed at driving Clementeens’
intrinsic learning motivation as they get to investigate an issue/ problem
that interests them.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Secondary 1 Geographical Investigation - Rain Garden</strong>
</p>
<p>In 2020, our school built a rain garden within the school confines. The
objective of Rain garden @ CTSS is to bring learning beyond the confines
of the classroom. Having a&nbsp; rain garden within the school compound
increases the accessibility of fieldwork to Clementeens across all levels,
hence allowing them to experience and apply what they learnt in the textbook
in the field and consequently, developing critical learners.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Secondary 3 Experiential Learning at Earth Alive Exhibition, Science Centre</strong>
</p>
<p>The ‘Earth Alive’ exhibition at Science Centre Singapore presents a unique
opportunity for our students to experience the processes that drive geohazards
such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, and climate change.
Through active, engaging exhibits and compelling visual displays, students
get a feel for some of Earth’s physical functionings through interactive
stimulations. Students directly experience working like geographers to
seek answers through guided inquiry at Science Centre. The SLS (Student
Learning Space) package to help students make sense of the interactives
and models in the exhibition and reach conclusions.</p>
<p>Students are able to experience through sight, touch, and sound. For example,
they will be able to see how seismic waves radiate outwards with P and
S waves which is important for them to link it to monitoring systems and
impacts created by earthquakes. Students having the opportunity to experience
what geographers do to make knowledge.</p>
