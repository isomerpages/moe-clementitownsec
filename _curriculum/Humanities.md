**Humanities: Teaching and Learning**&nbsp;

In Clementi Town Secondary School, we believe that our teachers’ main role in class is to be facilitators in our students’ pursuit for content and conceptual understanding. Our lessons are centered on the main pedagogical approach of Inquiry Based Learning, where our Clementeens become co-constructors of the knowledge covered in class by engaging in discussions and studying authentic and relevant sources. Coupled with the use of relevant ICT tools which connect our Clementeens to the world out there, we aim to develop critical learners and future-ready Clementeens by bringing education beyond the confines of the classroom.

  

**Social Studies: Entrepreneurship Programme for Sec 3 Normal Technical Social Studies**&nbsp;

The Humanities Department conceptualized an experiential learning entrepreneurship programme for Secondary 3NT students. This programme focuses on learning to be student-centered, purposeful and informal. Students were given the opportunity to apply their learning from Humanities lessons (Social Studies and Elements of Business Skills) through the planning and executing of a student-run business. Furthermore, as the programme links to the school’s VIA program, students were given the opportunity to reflect and enforce on certain character values such as empathy and compassion. As the students prepare to run a Bazaar at the end of Term 3, Teachers serve not as content deliverers but as facilitators for students to grasp concepts through the act of doing.  
  
We believe strongly that the provision of an authentic learning environment incorporating meaningful learning experiences will enhance and make the learning of Financial Literacy more palatable to meet the interests, profile and needs of our Secondary 3NT Pupils.  
  

**History: Historical Investigations**  

To enhance our Clementeens’ learning, Secondary 1 and 2 Clementeens were given the opportunity to embark on historical investigations that revolved around the concept of conflict. Over the years, our Secondary Two Clementeens were given the opportunity to embark on customized trails around key World War II sites such as Kranji War Memorial and Fort Factory. In 2019, Clementeens were given the opportunity to explore Fort Siloso as part of their Historical Investigations.&nbsp; They were able to learn more about Singapore’s darkest moments through the trails which our department teachers have specially crafted for them.&nbsp; Given the current COVID situation, our teachers tapped on online platforms and created an online trail that mimicked the actual journey that they would have taken had they been able to embark on a physical trail. This helps to ensure that learning continues to be vibrant and engaging despite the current limitations that we face.&nbsp;  

  

**Geography: Geographical Investigations**

Our choice of Geographical Investigation approach is by offering students choices in fieldwork. This form of inquiry-based learning allows students to engage proactively in their own investigation where the role of the teacher is of a facilitator in the classroom and at the field. Students were given the autonomy to decide on their hypothesis and were empowered to select their tools and methods of investigation. Figure 1 shows the GI process that the teachers had designed, aimed at driving students’ intrinsic learning motivation as they get to investigate an issue/ problem that interests them.
