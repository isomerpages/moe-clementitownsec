<h4><strong>MISSION</strong></h4>
<p>Through our curriculum and various enrichment programmes, we seek to develop
each Clementeen to be a proficient and confident user of their own Mother
Tongue Language and to develop students’ interest in their own Mother Tongue
culture. We nurture Clementeens who are able to exhibit the distinctive
values or beliefs of their own Mother Tongue Culture.</p>
<h4><strong>KEY PROGRAMMES</strong></h4>
<p><strong><u>Mother Tongue Fortnight Programme</u></strong>
</p>
<p>To enhance students' understanding and interest towards their own Mother
Tongue culture through experiential learning, the Mother Tongue department
organized the Mother Tongue Fortnight Programme for all students. A range
of interesting MTL activities, such as Chinese paper cutting, opera mask
painting, bean drawing, clay modelling, Malay Scabble, Indian Poetry Workshops,
were organized to expose students to their individual Mother Tongue culture.</p>
<h4><strong>CULTURAL IMMERSION TRIP TO BEIJING 2019</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;In order to cultivate cross-cultural skills, socio-cultural sensitivity
and global awareness, the Mother Tongue department has organized an overseas
cultural immersion trip to Beijing from 29 Oct to 3 Nov 2019. Besides local
school visits and attending a lecture in Peking University, students also
had the opportunities to visit famous cultural sites such as the Great
Wall of China, Forbidden Palace and Yuan Ming Yuan. Visits to the National
Museum of China and Science and Technology Museum had also enhanced students’
understanding of the history of China and the vast advancement of technology.&nbsp;</p>
