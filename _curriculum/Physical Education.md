<h4><strong>KEY PROGRAMMES</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Physical Health &amp; Fitness</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe that physical fitness is a core component in every Clementeen’s
formative years as a teenager. In addition to fitness and conditioning
through the sports and games modules, Clementeens undergo lessons aimed
at increasing their knowledge of fitness and health so as to prepare them
for their National Physical Fitness Award (NAPFA) Test during their Secondary
2 and 4/5 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sports &amp; Games</strong>
</p>
<p>The PE programme ensures that every Clementeen will learn 2 games each
year from either of the three game categories: Territorial-Invasion, Striking-Fielding
as well as Net-Barrier games throughout their time with the school.</p>
<p>The participation in games not only allows Clementeens to develop their
psychomotor skills and physical fitness, but also life skills and values.
Annual sports events (subject to prevailing restrictions), beyond intra-class
games, also provide a platform for Clementeens to demonstrate the outcomes
of their learning from the sports and games modules taught, as well as
to forge closer bonds with their peers.</p>
<p>The games and sports have been carefully selected to align with their
physical growth and development.</p>

<p><strong>CTX (CT Extravaganza)</strong>
</p>
<p>CTX provides an additional platform for Clementeens at Secondary 2 to
be exposed to sports and games that require resources not readily available
in the school. The exposure provides Clementeens a broader choice of sports
and games they can participate in as part of learning to have a healthy
lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>Racial-Harmony Day - Sports Carnival (RHD-Sports Carnival)</strong>
</p>
<p>Clementeens’ sense of belonging to the school and school spirit is deepen
through sports and games. Through the variety of games and activities in
the RHD-Sports Carnival, inclusivity is encouraged by catering to all groups
of Clementeens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Racial Harmony Day activities carried out in alignment with the Sports
Carnival develops a sense of reality and hope among Clementeens and allows
them to see how sports can be used to give back to the community, for team
building and for National Education.</p>
<h4><strong>SPORTS LEADERS PROGRAMME</strong></h4>
<p>Sports Leaders is part of the student leadership body group in CTSS that
focuses on the development of leadership and organizational skills through
Sports.</p>
<p>The aim of the Sports Leaders Programme is two-fold. It serves to help
students in Sports CCAs to develop:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Interest and Skills to serve the school community in a variety of areas,
including but not limited to sports; AND</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Qualities of leadership and Responsibility so as to demonstrate organizational
ability and decision-making skills by leading other Clementeens in sports
and recreational activities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With the training and leadership opportunities, Sports Leaders can get
to accomplish the following roles in the school:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Sports Ambassadors of the school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide support to teachers for the development of a well-rounded environment
for their respective Sports CCAs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lead and provide support to the PE department in the running of school
activities and events, such as Inter-Class/Inter-House Games, Well-Being
