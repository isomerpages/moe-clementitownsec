<h4><strong>MISSION:</strong></h4>
<p>To nurture Independent Learners with an Analytical mind for Problem Solving
who like to co-learn with others and appreciate the Relevance and Fun in
Mathematics</p>
<h4><strong>KEY PROGRAMMES</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Secondary 1 Mathematics Challenge Day</strong>Secondary 1 students
are involved in activities that provides the experiential application of
Mathematics. The students also learn through role-play with real-life issues
such as banking loans, fixed deposits, online shopping and being mindful
of online scams. There are areas on personal finance, financial terms and
budgeting too. These hands-on activities enable them to experience the
real-life application of Mathematics in everyday lives.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary 3 Mathematics Enrichment Activities</strong>Secondary
3 students are engaged in an interactive Life Long Learning (L3) Board
Game. Through the game, students are provided a simulation of real-life
situations so that they can learn to make education, career and financial
decisions in a fun and risk-free setting. They will also learn other important
concepts such as Purchasing a house, Buying a car, Savings, Insurances,
Stocks, CPF and Economic cycle. Some key objectives of the Mathematics
Enrichment include the importance of lifelong learning, Education &amp;
Career path and Financial Literacy.</p>
<p><strong>All Singapore Secondary Mathematics Competition for Normal Course Students</strong>The
Mathematics Department organizes a national-level online Mathematics competition
to stimulate greater interest and enrich studentsâ€™ knowledge in Mathematics
by providing an opportunity for Normal Course students to showcase their
talent in Mathematical knowledge and skills through solving competition
questions. The competition has been opened to all Normal Course students
from all secondary schools in Singapore since 2009. A total of 825 students
from 82 Secondary schools participated in the competition on 21 Jul 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Talent Development Programme</strong>
<br>Students with strong potential in Mathematics are identified early and
exposed to higher forms of Mathematical training beyond the curriculum.
They are provided with many opportunities to further stretch their abilities
in national-level competitions such as Singapore Mathematics Olympiads
and Singapore Mathematics Project Festivals and the Singapore Mathematical
Society (SMS) Essay Competition.</p>
<p>The Singapore Mathematical Project Festival is a nationwide event organized
annually by the Singapore Mathematical Society to encourage students to
explore Mathematics beyond the classroom work. Selected students worked
on a project aimed at carrying out and presenting innovative and creative
work in Mathematics. Students then presented their findings in a report
and an oral presentation.</p>
<p>In the Singapore Mathematical Society (SMS) Essay Competition, where the
objective of the competition is to expose students to various topics that
are related to mathematics. Such topics could be related to the history,
applications or other aspects of mathematics. For example, the theme of
the 2022 competition was "Mathematics and Environmental Sustainability".</p>
