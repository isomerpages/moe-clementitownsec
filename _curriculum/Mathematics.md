**Secondary 1 Mathematics Challenge Day**

Secondary 1 students are involved in activities that provides the experiential application of Mathematics. The students also learn through role-play with real-life issues such as banking loans, fixed deposits, online shopping and being mindful of online scams. There are areas on personal finance, financial&nbsp;terms and budgeting too. These hands-on activities enable them to experience the real-life application of Mathematics in everyday lives.

**Secondary 3 Mathematics Enrichment Activities**

Secondary 3 students are engaged in an interactive Life Long Learning (L3) Board Game.&nbsp; Through the game, students are provided a&nbsp;simulation of real-life situations so that they can learn to make education, career and financial&nbsp;decisions in a fun and risk-free setting. They will&nbsp;also learn other important concepts such as&nbsp;Purchasing a house, Buying&nbsp;a car, Savings,&nbsp;Insurances, Stocks, CPF and Economic cycle.&nbsp; Some key objectives of the Mathematics Enrichment include the importance of lifelong learning, Education &amp; Career path and Financial Literacy.

**All Singapore Secondary Mathematics Competition for Normal Course Students**

The Mathematics Department organises a national-level online Mathematics competition to stimulate greater interest and enrich students’ knowledge in Mathematics by providing an opportunity for Normal Course students to showcase their talent in Mathematical knowledge and skills through solving competition questions. The competition has been opened to all Normal Course students from all secondary schools in Singapore since 2009. A total of 766 students from 76 Secondary schools participated in the competition on 22 July 2021.

**Talent Development Programme**

Students with strong potential in Mathematics are identified early and exposed to higher forms of Mathematical training beyond the curriculum. They are provided with many opportunities to further stretch their abilities in national-level competitions such as Singapore Mathematics Olympiads and Singapore Mathematics Project Festivals.and the Singapore Mathematical Society (SMS) Essay Competition.

The Singapore Mathematical Project Festival is a nationwide event organised annually by the Singapore Mathematical Society to encourage students to explore Mathematics beyond the classroom work. Selected students worked on a project aimed at carrying out and presenting innovative and creative work in Mathematics. Students then presented their findings in a&nbsp;report&nbsp;and an oral presentation.

In the Singapore Mathematical Society (SMS) Essay Competition, where the&nbsp;objective of the competition is to expose students to various topics that are related to mathematics. Such topics could be related to the history, applications or other aspects of mathematics. For example, the&nbsp;theme of the 2021 competition was "Mathematics and Pandemics".&nbsp;
