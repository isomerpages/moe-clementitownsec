<h4><strong>MISSION</strong></h4>
<p>To develop Clementeens who are passionate lifelong learners that can problem
solve using scientific reasoning and thinking skills, communicate effectively
and collaborate productively with others in both physical and digital environments.</p>
<h4><strong>MOTTO</strong></h4>
<p>Think. Do. Love. Science</p>
<h4><strong>KEY PROGRAMMES</strong></h4>
<p>The department is dedicated in arousing and sustaining the interest in
science learning for all students by complementing the normal curriculum
with school-wide science enrichment, i.e. Clementeen Science Investigation
(CSI).</p>
<p>For students who are identified to have higher ability and who are passionate
in learning science beyond the normal curriculum, the department stretches
them through the provision of carefully curated science-related competitions.&nbsp;
These competitions are categorised into four focal strands, namely Academic-focused
competitions, Research-focused competitions, Innovation-focused competition
and Communication-focused competition.</p>

<p><strong><u>Research-Based Programme Science in Action (SiA)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The SiA programme is a research mentorship programme which cultivates
in our Sec 2 and Sec 3 students the spirit of inquiry. Students selected
for this programme will work on a year-long project under the mentorship
of a teacher or an expert from the tertiary institutions (e.g. NUS).&nbsp;
The projects done by students under SiA are fielded at national and international
platforms (e.g. SSEF, ASPC, GYSTB).</p>
<p><strong><u>Academic-Based Programme 1: International Biomedical Quiz</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our school participates in the biannual International Biomedical Quiz
organized by Anglo Chinese Junior College in collaboration with the Yong
Loo Lin School of Medicine. The trainings and competition provide a platform
for our upper secondary Biology students to develop their aptitude and
potential in the biomedical disciplines through independent work and applying
critical thinking to solve authentic medical challenges.</p>
<p><strong><u>Academic-Based Programme 2: Training for OlymPiads (TOP)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The TOP programme is a talent development programme for our Upper Secondary
students to prepare them for the national-level competitions (e.g. Singapore
Junior Chemistry Olympiad, Singapore Junior Biology Olympiad and Singapore
Junior Physics Olympiad).</p>
<p><strong><u>Innovation-Based Programme: UPSE</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Students passionate in innovation will be given opportunities to exercise
their creativity to innovate backing with scientific knowledge.&nbsp; Students
who sign up will be provided mentorship and given a chance to participate
in innovation-based competitions e.g. USPE and I am a Young Sustainability
Champion.</p>
<p><strong><u>Communication-Based Programme: Science Busker's Festival</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Effective communication is an important competency for scientists to collaborate
with peers. The Science department provides mentorship to students in communication-based
programmes. Students interested in science busking are welcome to sign
up for the mentorship.</p>
<p><strong><u>Science Programme for All Students: CSI</u></strong>
</p>
<p>CSI (Clementeen Science Investigation) is a school-based competition which
aims at arousing students’ interest in general science application in real
life.&nbsp; Students are provided with opportunities to apply their scientific
knowledge or concepts to solve real life problems.</p>
<h4><strong>ASEAN STUDENT SCIENCE PROJECT COMPETITION (ASPC) AND GLOBAL YOUTH SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY BOWL (GYSTB)</strong></h4>
<p>Students from the school’s Science-in-Action Research Mentorship Programme
participate in the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair (SSEF), which
is organised by the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Agency for Science,
Technology and Research (A*STAR) and the Science Centre Singapore (SCS).
The SSEF is affiliated to the prestigious Intel International Science and
Engineering Fair (Intel ISEF), which is regarded as the Olympics of Science
Competitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent years, SiA students have been nominated by MOE to represent
Singapore at the ASEAN Student Science Project Competition (ASPC) and the
Global Youth Science and Technology Bowl (GYSTB). We are pleased with the
efforts of our Clementeens and are proud of their achievements. They have
done Singapore and CTSS proud!</p>
<p>SiA students are very grateful to have been given opportunities to represent
Singapore in overseas competitions. It has helped them to broaden their
view of the world, our South-East Asian region, allowing them to learn
more about the culture of other ASEAN countries while simultaneously being
exposed to regional and international scientific projects and ideas.</p>
