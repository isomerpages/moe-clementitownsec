<h4><strong>DEPARTMENT OBJECTIVES</strong></h4>
<p>The Craft &amp; Technology and Aesthetics Department offers applied learning
subjects such as Art, Design &amp; Technology, Food and Consumer Education/
Food &amp; Nutrition and Music.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The department aims to develop students by encouraging critical thinking

<h4><strong>ART UNIT</strong></h4>
<p><strong><u>MISSION</u></strong>
<br>To enable every Clementeen to appreciate art and be equipped with fundamental
art skills</p>
<p><strong><u>KEY PROGRAMMES</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In CTSS, art lessons are planned closely in line with MOE syllabus guidelines:</p>
<p>It exists all around us in different forms; from the colours, shapes and
patterns in nature to everyday images and designs on magazines, products
and media. As an academic subject in the school curriculum, art is integral
to the holistic development of every student. The value of art in the curriculum
is in the following areas:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Art fosters students’ sense of identity, culture and place in society</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Art builds students’ capacity to critically discern and process visual
information, and communicate effectively in the 21st Century</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The aims of art education in our school are to enable every child to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>enjoy art,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>communicate visually, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make meaning through connecting with society and culture.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Guided by these aims, the school art curriculum across all levels provides
our students with a balanced and well-rounded education in the aesthetic,
cognitive and affective dimensions. It presents ample opportunities for
creative and innovative self-expression in varied modes. It also contributes
to developing a fuller range of our students’ interests and talents. The
learning of local artworks and artists strengthens the understanding of
the individual’s national identity by fostering the appreciation of one’s
cultural heritage.</p>
<p>The overarching framework for art syllabuses at secondary level is presented
in Figure 1.</p>

<p>The syllabus framework, presented in the form of a colour wheel, illustrates
the dynamic relationships amongst the various key features of the art syllabus.
It presents an integrated concept for the learning of art that is holistic
and enduring. It serves as a compass to guide cohesive and effective learning
and teaching of art across all schools.</p>
<p>The exposure and study of different media allow for understanding of the
characteristics, potential and limitations of media. Learning about media
includes knowing the commonly used materials, becoming familiar with the
tools required and understanding the technical processes involved.</p>
<p>In addition to the listed art media, the school&nbsp; also extend students’
learning to other relevant media according to students’ needs and interests.
Visual Qualities Artists use a wide range of elements of art and principles
of design to create art. These elements and principles do not occur in
isolation but function in tandem with one another to achieve desired visual
effects. The focus of learning is to understand the features of different
elements and principles, and the use of these in different art forms to
create certain effects. Students learn about the application of these elements
and principles within specific art forms and media. The elements and principles
in the syllabus consist of but are not limited to:</p>

<p><strong>FRAMEWORK OF THE UPPER SECONDARY ART</strong>
</p>
<p>The framework for the Upper Secondary Art syllabus is structured under
three learning domains of Perceiving, Communicating and Appreciating. These
learning domains take into consideration the cognitive, psychomotor and
affective dimensions that students are involved in when they are engaged
in the visual arts. The three domains are interconnected and operate dynamically.</p>
<p>Under the domain of Perceiving, students respond to and interpret visual
images and objects sensitively and informatively. They learn to discriminate
and make connections between different visual qualities and phenomena.
Through observing and analysing visual stimuli in nature and the man-made
environment as well as works of art, students develop visual awareness
and sensitivities that encourage imagination and the generation of ideas.</p>
<p>Under the domain of Communicating, students express their thoughts, experiences
and feelings in visual, tactile, oral or literary forms. This involves
drawing on ideas, organising information, solving problems and expressing
intent and purpose. Through research and exploration, students develop
process skills to reinforce the effectiveness of communicating.</p>
<p>Under the domain of Appreciating, students value the visual arts as a
means of expression. Students learn to evaluate and appreciate artworks
made by themselves and other artists. They are able to see the connection
of the visual arts to their lives and better appreciate its significance
in the wider context of culture and society. Students develop aesthetic
and cultural awareness from which personal and cultural identities could
be examined and built upon. Through this, students will continue their
interest and participation in the visual arts beyond school.</p>
<p><strong>SYLLABUS CONTENT (UPPER SECONDARY ART SYLLABUS)</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;The content of the syllabus comprises Studio Practice and Study
of Visual Arts. The creation of artworks and the critical appraisal of
artists and artworks are two modes of learning that are central to a balanced
art education. These components provide students with diverse learning
experiences and skills in visual literacy.</p>
<p><strong>Studio Practice</strong>
</p>
<p>The Studio Practice engages students in the creation of artworks. Students
hone their observation skills, learn to discriminate visual qualities and
give form to their ideas and experiences when they are engaged in art making.
The Studio Practice provides opportunities for students to acquire a working
understanding of various art elements and principles. It also develops
competency in manipulating various art media for self-expression. Students
would be given opportunities to explore a good range of media and experiment
with different techniques in their studio practice. Students acquire skills
such as research, experimentation and exploration, idea development, personal
reflection and evaluation in the process of creating artworks. Preparatory
studies are an integral and important part of the Studio Practice. Through
the preparatory studies, students learn to think through issues and problems
and develop their abilities to translate ideas into artworks</p>

<h4><strong>DESIGN &amp; TECHNOLOGY UNIT</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To nurture students with designerly dispositions through designing and
making.</p>
<p>The designerly dispositions are as follows: 1. embracing uncertainties
and complexities 2. be cognizant of and resolve real-world, ill-defined
problems 3. relentless drive to seek out how things work 4. use of doodling
and sketching, and 3D manipulation of resistant materials as a language
for visualisation, communication and presentation.</p>
<p><strong><u>Key Programmes</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Design &amp; Technology (DT) Unit runs a four year programme equipping
the pupils with the knowledge and skills for their N and O levels examinations.
Lower secondary pupils learn basic technologies, designing processes and
hands-on skills. They get to put the knowledge into practice, cumulating
in mini-projects and prototypes.</p>
<p>We prepare the upper secondary pupils for their N and O levels examinations
at Secondary Three by assimilating to the requirements of the national
examinations, involving knowledge application and problem-solving. They
expand on their basic knowledge to develop greater understanding and appreciation
of the relatedness to real-life situations. They also take on real-time
design tasks to arrive at feasible design solutions.</p>
<p>Students from different levels also participate in external competitions
such as Annual Design &amp; Technology Awards&nbsp;and Science and Technology
Challenge organised by Nanyang Polytechnic annually.</p>
