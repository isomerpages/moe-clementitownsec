<h4><strong>READ@CTSS</strong></h4>
<p>To instill the love of reading and inculcate good reading habits in our
Clementeens, we have a structured and supervised time slot for Clementeens
to immerse themselves in a good book of their choice. In our English curriculum,
we introduce popular teenage fiction to our Clementeens with Narratives
Thursdays, and proceed to build general and current affairs knowledge in
our upper secondary levels through the exposure to articles of non-fiction
genres . CTSS R.E.A.D model is employed to encourage Clementeens to respond
critically to their reading texts. This reading technique, that is developed
in-house , hones students’ critical reading skills as they react, explore,
analyse and discern the text. At the end of the 4 to 5 years of CTSS reading
programme, our Clementeens will be familiar with a multitude of genres,
and have a broadened mindset that will prepare them for their next phase
of higher education.</p>
<h4><strong>PerspeCTives!</strong></h4>
<p>To develop Clementeens with the 21st century competencies for a globalised
world, the department has curated <a href="#_msocom_1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[NLKA1]</a>&nbsp;PerspeCTives to develop our Clementeens
with civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills, critical
and inventive thinking, and communication, collaboration, and information
skills. PerspeCTives extends training and learning for our Clementeens
through the following 3 Cs:</p>
<p><strong>Curate ­–</strong> Digital content curation on current affairs
and school events</p>

<p>PerspeCTives aims to develop our Clementeens in creating content and imparting
knowledge by increasing media literacy and sparking meaningful conversations
about currents affairs amongst participants. Clementeens will also have
the opportunity to serve as journalists, reporters, interviewers and podcasters,
and have their works showcased.</p>
<h4><strong>Talent Development</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Public Speaking Competition</strong>
</p>
<p>In CTSS, we believe in providing ample avenues and opportunities for our
Clementeens to participate in public speaking. Clementeens with good oratorical
skills are identified and trained to participate in competitions such as
the YMCA Plain English Speaking Awards, ACJC Orator’s Trophy.</p>
