<h3><strong>Key Activities</strong>:</h3>
<h4><strong>READ@CTSS</strong></h4>
<p>To instill the love of reading and inculcate good reading habits in our
Clementeens, we have a structured and supervised time slot for Clementeens
to immerse themselves in a good book of their choice. In our English curriculum,
we introduce popular teenage fiction to our Clementeens and proceed to
build general and current affairs knowledge in our upper secondary levels
through the exposure to articles of non-fiction genres. CTSS R.E.A.D model
is employed to encourage Clementeens to respond critically to their reading
texts. This reading technique, that is developed in-house, hones students’
critical reading skills as they react, explore, analyse and discern the
text. Our READ@CTSS microsite has a wide variety of reading articles that
span over different genres to meet the reading proficiency and interests
of our readers. In tandem with our whole school approach to READ@CTSS,
we also have fun reading activities such as Escape Room, The Golden Ticket
and Readvolution to engage our Clementeens in their reading. At the end
of their 4 to 5 years of READ@CTSS, our Clementeens will be familiar with
a multitude of genres, and have a broadened mindset that will prepare them
for their future.</p>

<h4><strong>PerspeCTives!</strong></h4>
<p>To develop Clementeens with the 21st century competencies for a globalised
world, the department has curated <a href="#_msocom_1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[NLKA1]</a>&nbsp;PerspeCTives to develop our Clementeens
with civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills, critical
and inventive thinking, and communication, collaboration, and information
skills. PerspeCTives extends training and learning for our Clementeens
through the following 3 Cs:</p>
<p><strong>Curate ­–</strong> Digital content curation on current affairs
and school events</p>

<p>PerspeCTives aims to develop our Clementeens in creating content and imparting
knowledge by increasing media literacy and sparking meaningful conversations
about currents affairs amongst participants. Clementeens will also have
the opportunity to serve as journalists, reporters, interviewers and podcasters,
and have their works showcased.</p>
<h4><strong>Talent Development</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Public Speaking Competition</strong>
</p>
<p>In CTSS, we believe in providing ample avenues and opportunities for our
Clementeens to participate in public speaking. Clementeens with good oratorical
skills are identified and trained to participate in competitions such as
the YMCA Plain English Speaking Awards, ACJC Orator’s Trophy.</p>
