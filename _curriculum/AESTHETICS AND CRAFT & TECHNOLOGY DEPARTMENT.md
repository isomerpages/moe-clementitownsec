**MISSION**  
To enable every Clementeen to appreciate art and be equipped with fundamental art skills  
  

**KEY PROGRAMMES**

In CTSS, art lessons are planned closely in line with MOE syllabus guidelines:  
  
It exists all around us in different forms; from the colours, shapes and patterns in nature to everyday images and designs on magazines, products and media. As an academic subject in the school curriculum, art is integral to the holistic development of every student. The value of art in the curriculum is in the following areas:  

*   Art fosters students’ sense of identity, culture and place in society
*   Art builds students’ capacity to critically discern and process visual information, and communicate effectively in the 21st Century

  
The aims of art education in our school are to enable every child to:  

*   enjoy art,
*   communicate visually, and  
    
*   make meaning through connecting with society and culture.

  

Guided by these aims, the school art curriculum across all levels provides our students with a balanced and well-rounded education in the aesthetic, cognitive and affective dimensions. It presents ample opportunities for creative and innovative self-expression in varied modes. It also contributes to developing a fuller range of our students’ interests and talents. The learning of local artworks and artists strengthens the understanding of the individual’s national identity by fostering the appreciation of one’s cultural heritage.
