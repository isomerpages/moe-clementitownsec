**MISSION**  
To enable every Clementeen to appreciate art and be equipped with fundamental art skills  
  

**KEY PROGRAMMES**

In CTSS, art lessons are planned closely in line with MOE syllabus guidelines:  
  
It exists all around us in different forms; from the colours, shapes and patterns in nature to everyday images and designs on magazines, products and media. As an academic subject in the school curriculum, art is integral to the holistic development of every student. The value of art in the curriculum is in the following areas:  

*   Art fosters students’ sense of identity, culture and place in society
*   Art builds students’ capacity to critically discern and process visual information, and communicate effectively in the 21st Century

  
The aims of art education in our school are to enable every child to:  

*   enjoy art,
*   communicate visually, and  
    
*   make meaning through connecting with society and culture.

  

Guided by these aims, the school art curriculum across all levels provides our students with a balanced and well-rounded education in the aesthetic, cognitive and affective dimensions. It presents ample opportunities for creative and innovative self-expression in varied modes. It also contributes to developing a fuller range of our students’ interests and talents. The learning of local artworks and artists strengthens the understanding of the individual’s national identity by fostering the appreciation of one’s cultural heritage.

The syllabus framework, presented in the form of a colour wheel, illustrates the dynamic relationships amongst the various key features of the art syllabus. It presents an integrated concept for the learning of art that is holistic and enduring. It serves as a compass to guide cohesive and effective learning and teaching of art across all schools.

The exposure and study of different media allow for understanding of the characteristics, potential and limitations of media. Learning about media includes knowing the commonly used materials, becoming familiar with the tools required and understanding the technical processes involved.

In addition to the listed art media, the school&nbsp; also extend students’ learning to other relevant media according to students’ needs and interests. Visual Qualities Artists use a wide range of elements of art and principles of design to create art. These elements and principles do not occur in isolation but function in tandem with one another to achieve desired visual effects. The focus of learning is to understand the features of different elements and principles, and the use of these in different art forms to create certain effects. Students learn about the application of these elements and principles within specific art forms and media. The elements and principles in the syllabus consist of but are not limited to:

Elements of Art and Principles of Design in Lower Secondary Art Elements of Art Principles of Design:

*   Lines&nbsp;&nbsp;
*   Shapes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*   Forms&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*   Colours&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*   Textures&nbsp;
*   Space
*   Harmony&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*   Balance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*   Contrast&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*   Scale&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*   Movement&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*   Emphasis

**FRAMEWORK OF THE UPPER SECONDARY ART**

The framework for the Upper Secondary Art syllabus is structured under three learning domains of Perceiving, Communicating and Appreciating. These learning domains take into consideration the cognitive, psychomotor and affective dimensions that students are involved in when they are engaged in the visual arts. The three domains are interconnected and operate dynamically.

Under the domain of Perceiving, students respond to and interpret visual images and objects sensitively and informatively. They learn to discriminate and make connections between different visual qualities and phenomena. Through observing and analysing visual stimuli in nature and the man-made environment as well as works of art, students develop visual awareness and sensitivities that encourage imagination and the generation of ideas.

Under the domain of Communicating, students express their thoughts, experiences and feelings in visual, tactile, oral or literary forms. This involves drawing on ideas, organising information, solving problems and expressing intent and purpose. Through research and exploration, students develop process skills to reinforce the effectiveness of communicating.

Under the domain of Appreciating, students value the visual arts as a means of expression. Students learn to evaluate and appreciate artworks made by themselves and other artists. They are able to see the connection of the visual arts to their lives and better appreciate its significance in the wider context of culture and society. Students develop aesthetic and cultural awareness from which personal and cultural identities could be examined and built upon. Through this, students will continue their interest and participation in the visual arts beyond school.

**SYLLABUS CONTENT (UPPER SECONDARY ART SYLLABUS)**

&nbsp;The content of the syllabus comprises Studio Practice and Study of Visual Arts. The creation of artworks and the critical appraisal of artists and artworks are two modes of learning that are central to a balanced art education. These components provide students with diverse learning experiences and skills in visual literacy.

**Studio Practice**

The Studio Practice engages students in the creation of artworks. Students hone their observation skills, learn to discriminate visual qualities and give form to their ideas and experiences when they are engaged in art making. The Studio Practice provides opportunities for students to acquire a working understanding of various art elements and principles. It also develops competency in manipulating various art media for self-expression. Students would be given opportunities to explore a good range of media and experiment with different techniques in their studio practice. Students acquire skills such as research, experimentation and exploration, idea development, personal reflection and evaluation in the process of creating artworks. Preparatory studies are an integral and important part of the Studio Practice. Through the preparatory studies, students learn to think through issues and problems and develop their abilities to translate ideas into artworks
