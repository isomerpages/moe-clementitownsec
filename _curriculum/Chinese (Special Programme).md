<p><strong><u>About Chinese (Special Programme)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Chinese (Special Programme) is a four-year course beginning in Secondary
One and leading to the GCE O-level examination at the end of Secondary
Four*. It is a Chinese language programme for students whose Mother Tongue
Language is not Chinese.</p>
<p>C(SP) is offered to provide opportunity for more students to learn a third
language and&nbsp;is part of MOE’s effort to offer more options in the
education system to cater to the differing interests and abilities of our
students. It will also help to nurture a group of Singaporeans who can
better understand the values, culture and worldview of another community
in Singapore. Besides acquiring the linguistic skills in listening, speaking,
reading and writing, students will learn to appreciate the culture and
values embedded in the Chinese Language.</p>
<p>The teaching method will be varied and activity-based. Besides studying
the textbooks, students will have ample opportunity to engage in language
activities such as listening to and telling stories, holding conversations
and discussing topics of interest to students, reporting of news and role
playing. Students will also have opportunities to participate in cultural
activities which include appreciation of Chinese painting, calligraphy,
Chinese music etc. ICT will be used as a tool to make the teaching lively
and to help students in self-learning.</p>
<p><em>*The programme&nbsp;cannot be offered as a replacement for a MTL subject.</em>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Bonus Points for Admission</u></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students who passed C(SP) at ‘O’ level would be given two bonus points&nbsp;for
admission into Junior College (JC) and Millennia Institute (MI).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The C(SP) grade could be used in lieu of a Humanities subject in the&nbsp;L1R5
aggregate score (L1R5) for admission into JC or MI.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>*With effect from Jan 2012, students who have prior knowledge in the language (e.g. had acquired a PSLE-equivalent proficiency)/ MTL-exempted and show an interest to offer C(SP) are required to obtain approval from CPDD through their schools. The ‘O’ level C(SP) grades of these groups of students cannot be used for L1R5 aggregate computation and they will not enjoy the incentives for purpose of JC admission (i.e. bonus points for JC admission and using CSP grade in lieu of Humanities). In addition, while grades obtained from internal assessments may be documented on school result slips, they cannot be counted towards in-school progression.</em>
