Our School Curriculum Framework articulates our beliefs which guide us in the design of student learning experiences for all Clementeens. so that they will be prepared for the future – a world characterised by volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity as a result of globalisation, technological advancements and economic restructuring.

We believe that _every Clementeen wants to and can become **self-determined** by developing the **growth mindset** and **skills to learn well**_**.**

The School Curriculum Framework comprises the:

*   **Desired Student** **Outcomes** which are in line with our school mission of developing all Clementeens with the **passion to learn**, **confidence to lead**, and **humility to serve**. These outcomes include the values, attitudes and dispositions that Clementeens should have; the body of knowledge and skills that Clementeens should learn; and the observable behaviours and actions that they should demonstrate.

*   **Elements of student-centric educational experiences,** which include how we establish a **positive learning culture** through fostering positive relationships between students and teachers as well as among students, and motivating students to have a mastery goal orientation and growth mindset. Teachers **design and implement learning experiences** to meet the varied needs of our Clementeens through differentiated approaches, sound assessment practices and the use of educational technology, combined with the knowledge of how to deliver the subject matter through approaches unique to each subject.
