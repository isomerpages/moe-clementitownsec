<p>Our school was one of the Phase 1 schools which started offering Subject-Based
Banding (SBB) in 2017. With SBB, N(A) and N(T) students are given the opportunities
to offer subjects at a higher-level from the start of Secondary One â€“ previously,
they could only start doing so from Secondary Three. This allows students
to build a stronger foundation in subjects that they are good at, nurture
their strengths and give them more opportunities throughout their educational
journey, so that they are more engaged in learning.</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility Criteria for SBB</strong>
</p>
<p>Secondary One N(A) and N(T) students who meet the following criteria based
on their PSLE results are eligible for SBB:</p>

<p>Each student should take no more than 3 higher-level subjects so as to
ensure that he/she can cope with the overall academic demands.</p>
<p><strong>Other Opportunities to Participate in SBB</strong>
</p>
<p>For students who did not meet the eligibility criteria for SBB at the
start of Secondary One, they can still be considered for SBB if they do
well in their learning in Secondary One. These students will join SBB at
the end of Secondary One Term 2 or Secondary One Term 4 as the mid-year
or end-year SBB inserts.</p>
<p>Our school will provide support through bridging programmes for these
new SBB students.</p>
