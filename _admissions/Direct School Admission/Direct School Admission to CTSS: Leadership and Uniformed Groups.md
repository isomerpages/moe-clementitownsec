Clementi Town Secondary School offers its DSA under the Leadership and Uniformed Groups strand and is focused on **_Student Leadership Development through the Uniformed Groups (UG)_**. All successful applicants under the DSA scheme will be allocated a UG as their core CCA.

Clementi Town Secondary School (CTSS) envisions a vibrant community of students who have the passion to learn, confidence to lead and humility to serve. To achieve this, we believe in providing a holistic education for our students and encouraging them to pursue their passions and interests. The focus on Leadership Development through the UG further supports our strategic thrust of helping our students to be ‘Future-Ready’. They do so by providing an excellent infrastructure for students to achieve our school goals, vision and mission. In addition, the variety of activities within UGs further lends itself to the development and growth of its members. Furthermore, UGs at CTSS have consistently demonstrated outstanding achievements.

In addition, as the school attracts and develops niche-related talents, these talents will inspire the other students to reach an even higher standard in both academic and co-curricular areas in line with our belief and commitment for all Clementeens to ‘Aspire and Grow’ - our school motto.
