<p>Clementi Town Secondary School offers its DSA under the Leadership and
Uniformed Groups strand and is focused on <strong><em>Student Leadership Development through the Uniformed Groups (UG)</em></strong>.
All successful applicants under this DSA Talent Area will be allocated
a UG as their core CCA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clementi Town Secondary School (CTSS) envisions a vibrant community of
students who have the passion to learn, confidence to lead and humility
to serve. To achieve this, we believe in providing a holistic education
for our students and encouraging them to pursue their passions and interests.
The focus on Leadership Development through the UG further supports our
strategic thrust of helping our students to be ‘Future-Ready’. They do
so by providing an excellent infrastructure for students to achieve our
school goals, vision and mission. In addition, the variety of activities
within UGs further lends itself to the development and growth of its members.
Furthermore, UGs at CTSS have consistently demonstrated outstanding achievements.</p>

<p>The goal for CTSS in the LLP is to give more opportunities to students
to learn and demonstrate the School Values of Adaptability, Self-discipline,
Perseverance, Integrity and Respect, as well as to be developed as student
leaders through the UGs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, as the school attracts and develops niche-related talents,
these talents will inspire the other students to reach an even higher standard
in both academic and co-curricular areas in line with our belief and commitment
