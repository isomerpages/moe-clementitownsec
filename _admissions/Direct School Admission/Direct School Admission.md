In the recent press release, the Ministry of Education (MOE) announced that selected secondary schools can invite students to participate in the 2022 DSA-Sec Exercise for Admission to Secondary One in 2023.&nbsp;

Introduced in 2004, the Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme provides students with the opportunity to seek admission to a secondary school, based on a diverse range of specific academic and non-academic achievements and talents that they can demonstrate beyond the PSLE.

**Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.**

**Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school, and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for from year 1 – 4.**

For Admission to Secondary One in 2023, Clementi Town Secondary School is pleased to offer DSA in the following areas:
