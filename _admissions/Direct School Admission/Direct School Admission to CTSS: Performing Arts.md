<h4><strong>DRAMA CLUB (MIXED)</strong></h4>
<p>Clementi Town Drama Club (CT Drama) was first started in Clementi Town
Secondary School with the vision to achieve the ‘5Es’ of Arts Education
– Exposure, Experience, Experiment, Evaluate, and Educate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Clementi Town, Drama Club focuses on educating our students about the
human condition and teaching values through theatre - empathy, respect,
love - and reinforcing the school values of adaptability and self-discipline.
In CT Drama, students are strongly encouraged to develop their strengths
and interests with discipline and zeal. Alongside passionate teachers,
our CT Drama students have managed to receive tremendous recognition in
multiple aspects.</p>

<p>For the students who choose Drama as their CCA, they are put through training
in three areas – Cast, Crew and Creatives.</p>
<p>For Cast work, students undergo rigorous training in acting to hone their
skills of voice projection, stage presence and characterization. Crew work
focuses on training students to run events, and in the stage-management
of a big production. They are also trained in stage make-up, and the managing
of sounds and lighting of a show. For Creative work, students are encouraged
to write scripts, choreograph dances, design publicity materials and design
experiential elements for the shows that we put up.</p>
<p>CT Drama also helms the production of the biennial school musical since
it began in 2009. To date, we have progressed from staging it in the school
hall to performing in:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>NAFA Lee Foundation Theatre (2022)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NUS’ University Cultural Centre (2020, 2018)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and Victoria Theatre (2016)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The CT Musical journey began in 2009, and we staged our 7th musical in
2022 at the NAFA Lee Foundation Theatre. The ground-up production sees
the devotion of both alumni and current students. CT Drama believes in
providing our students with quality and authentic performing experience.
With a 25-person teacher team behind each production and a six-month long
preparation for the eventual show in June, CT Musicals aim to always teach
students strong lessons of life and values.</p>
<p>Other than our school musical, students will also get opportunities to
put up performances to hone their craft. Some examples of our performances
