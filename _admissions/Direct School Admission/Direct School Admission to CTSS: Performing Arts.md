DRAMA CLUB (MIXED)
------------------

Clementi Town Drama Club (CT Drama) was first started in Clementi Town Secondary School by Ms Valane Tnee with the vision to achieve the ‘5Es’ of Arts Education – Exposure, Experience, Experiment, Evaluate, and Educate.

In Clementi Town, Drama Club focuses on educating our students about the human condition and teaching values through theatre- empathy, respect, love- and reinforcing the school values of adaptability and self-discipline. In CT Drama, students are strongly encouraged to develop their strengths and interests with discipline and zeal. Alongside passionate teachers, our CT Drama students have managed to do receive tremendous recognition in multiple aspects.

For the students who choose Drama as CCA, they are put through training in three areas – Cast, Crew and Creatives.

For Cast work, students undergo rigorous training in acting to hone their skills of voice projection, stage presence and characterization. Crew work focuses on training students to run events, and in the stage-management of a big production. They are also trained in stage make-up, and the managing of sound and lighting of a show. For Creative work, students are encouraged to write scripts and have opportunities to choreograph dances for the shows that we put up, outside of school.

CT Drama also helms the production of the biennial school musical since it began in 2009. To date, we have progressed from staging it in the school hall to performing in:

* NAFA Lee Foundation Theatre (2022)
* NUS’ University Cultural Centre (2020, 2018)
* and Victoria Theatre (2016)

The CT Musical journey began in 2009, and we staged our 6th musical in 2018 at University Cultural Centre. The ground-up production sees the devotion of both alumni and current students. CT Drama believes in providing our students with quality and authentic performing experience. With a 25-person teacher team behind each production and a six-month long preparation for the eventual show in June, CT Musical aims to always teach students strong lessons of life and values.

Other than our school musical, students will also get opportunities to put up performances to hone their craft. Some examples of our performances include:

*CT Drama’s Online Interactive Play- REPLAY \[A Virtual Time Machine\] 2021
* CT Drama’s 1st online production- The Show Must Go On 2020
* FOUR (四) @ SOTA Studio Theatre 2019
