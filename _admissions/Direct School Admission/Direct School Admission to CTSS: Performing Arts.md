<h4><strong>DRAMA CLUB (MIXED)</strong></h4>
<p>Clementi Town Drama Club (CT Drama) was first started in Clementi Town
Secondary School by Ms Valane Tnee with the vision to achieve the ‘5Es’
of Arts Education – Exposure, Experience, Experiment, Evaluate, and Educate.</p>
<p>In Clementi Town, Drama Club focuses on educating our students about the
human condition and teaching values through theatre- empathy, respect,
love- and reinforcing the school values of adaptability and self-discipline.
In CT Drama, students are strongly encouraged to develop their strengths
and interests with discipline and zeal. Alongside passionate teachers,
our CT Drama students have managed to do receive tremendous recognition
in multiple aspects.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/dsa%20drama.jpg">
</div>
<p>For the students who choose Drama as CCA, they are put through training
in three areas – Cast, Crew and Creatives.</p>
<p>For Cast work, students undergo rigorous training in acting to hone their
skills of voice projection, stage presence and characterization. Crew work
focuses on training students to run events, and in the stage-management
of a big production. They are also trained in stage make-up, and the managing
of sound and lighting of a show. For Creative work, students are encouraged
to write scripts and have opportunities to choreograph dances for the shows
that we put up, outside of school.</p>
<p>CT Drama also helms the production of the biennial school musical since
it began in 2009. To date, we have progressed from staging it in the school
hall to performing in:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>NAFA Lee Foundation Theatre (2022)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NUS’ University Cultural Centre (2020, 2018)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and Victoria Theatre (2016)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The CT Musical journey began in 2009, and we staged our 6th musical in
2018 at University Cultural Centre. The ground-up production sees the devotion
of both alumni and current students. CT Drama believes in providing our
students with quality and authentic performing experience. With a 25-person
teacher team behind each production and a six-month long preparation for
the eventual show in June, CT Musical aims to always teach students strong
lessons of life and values.</p>
<p>Other than our school musical, students will also get opportunities to
put up performances to hone their craft. Some examples of our performances
include:</p>
<p>*CT Drama’s Online Interactive Play- REPLAY [A Virtual Time Machine] 2021</p>
