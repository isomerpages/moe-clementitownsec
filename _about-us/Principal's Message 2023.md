        Welcome back to school, Clementeens! To our Secondary Ones joining us this year, let me extend a very warm welcome to you on behalf of our school. We look forward to having you join our CT family and walking with you in this exciting new stretch of your learning journey. I also look forward to partnering your parents in supporting you in your growth.  
  
        A new year brings with it renewed hopes and aspirations. It is a chance for us to start afresh by reflecting on the year that has gone by. It is important that we recount the good and the bad of the past year and learn from our past experiences as we set our goals for the new academic year. 2022 is the year that our nation returned to normalcy with the easing of the safe management measures that we had implemented in the last two years. It was encouraging to be able to have our Clementeens experience secondary school life as it was always meant to be: social, vibrant and joyful.  
  
        As we enter 2023, we plan to bring back even more of the school experiences that we were not able to conduct in the last few years due to the pandemic. While the programmes might be the same, the delivery of some of these programmes might change. We will want to continue the good things that we have learnt from Covid-19 pandemic and infuse it in our school processes moving forward. For example, we will be adopting the hybrid approach for some of our programmes. We also learned the importance of imbuing in our students greater agency, growth mindset and mental resilience so that they can better manage the challenges that might come their way. The world has changed and thus we also must evolve as a school.  
  
        In the last one year, we have come together to re-envision the future that we want for our school in the next five years. We conducted several rounds of conversation with all our stakeholders to seek their inputs and ideas. The year-long engagement culminated with the conceptualisation of our ‘Strategic Plan 2023 – 2027’. With the new strategic plan, we have articulated the clear direction that the school will go towards, to better realise our school vision. We want to continue to build on our school’s strong foundation and the good work of the staff as we develop our Clementeens to have the passion to learn, the confidence to lead and the humility to serve.  
  
        I look forward to the support from our dedicated staff, parents and partners as we journey together in 2023.  
  
Thank you.  
  
Educating with you,  
  
Rasidah Binte Rahim  
Principal  
Clementi Town Secondary School
