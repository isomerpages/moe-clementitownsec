Darren Chan Shun Jie (4C1) and Swee Si Min (4D1) are from the school’s Science-in-Action Research Mentorship Programme. They participated in the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair (SSEF) 2018, which was organised by the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR) and the Science Centre Singapore (SCS). The SSEF is affiliated to the prestigious Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (Intel ISEF), which is regarded as the Olympics of Science Competitions.  
  
They worked hard and were awarded with a Gold Award at SSEF 2018 for their efforts. Darren and Si Min, together with Timothy Tan from Hwa Chong Institution were nominated by MOE to represent Singapore at the Fourth ASEAN Student Science Project Competition (ASPC) 2018, which was held at the National Science Museum in Pathum Thani, Thailand, from 21 July to 27 July 2018. This competition aimed to encourage students in developing skills in Science and Technology such as experimentation, communication and innovation. Participating in this competition allowed the students in the ASEAN countries to practise solving problems in daily life and provided a venue for students to foster friendships and networking amongst each other. Darren and Si Min managed to obtain a Second Prize in the Biological Science Category for their research project ‘DNA Repair requires the Eviction of the Linker Histone H1 from the site of damaged DNA’. They have indeed done country and CTSS proud!  
  
Darren and Si Min are very grateful to have been given this opportunity to represent Singapore in an overseas competition. It has helped them to broaden their view of our South-East Asian region, allowing them to learn more about the culture of other ASEAN countries while simultaneously being exposed to regional scientific projects and ideas.
