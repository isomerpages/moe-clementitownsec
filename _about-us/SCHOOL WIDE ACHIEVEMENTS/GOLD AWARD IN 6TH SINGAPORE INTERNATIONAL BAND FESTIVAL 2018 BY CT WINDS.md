CTWinds participated in the 6th&nbsp;Singapore International Band Festival (SIBF), a biennial festival organised by the Wind Bands Association of Singapore.

The aim of SIBF is to provide a comprehensive experience to develop bands through a competition, masterclasses, exchanges and concerts. Through this festival, bands from all over the world will be brought together in Singapore for an exchange of musical ideas and ideals, where musicians of all ages would be encouraged to continuously learn and strive towards excellence at their own pace.

The Band has worked very hard during their 6 months of preparation. Their hard work paid off when the Band competed against bands from Taiwan, Malaysia and Australia, and attained a Gold Award in Division 2A.&nbsp;As part of the Festival, the Band was also honoured to have Mr Felix Hauswirth, Professor of Conducting at Basel University Switzerland, conduct a clinic session, giving the Band greater insight on how much more they can develop musically.

The Band would like to put on record their appreciation to their conductors Mr Alvin Seville and Mr Tarun Jayaram for their musical guidance, and the Band teachers-in-charge for their constant encouragement and support. The Band will continue to work hard to share more wonderful music with the audience.
