The Mathematics Department organises a national-level online Mathematics competition to stimulate greater interest and enrich students’ knowledge in Mathematics by providing an opportunity for Normal Course students to showcase their talent in Mathematical knowledge and skills through solving competition questions. The competition has been opened to all Normal Course students from all secondary schools in Singapore since 2009. There are 4 categories in the competition, namely, Lower Sec Normal (A), Upper Sec Normal (A), Lower Sec Normal (T) and Upper Sec Normal (T).  This year 801 students from 71 secondary schools participated in the competition on 19 July 2018.   

We would like to share the good news that our Sec 4NA students did the school proud by winning 1st Position in the Team for Upper Sec Normal (A) Category. They have also won in the individual awards (there are only top 20 Individual awards per categogy):  

\- Ryan Khoo Kang Jun (4A2) won 4th position,

\- Chew Chin Kiat (4B2) won 11th position and
