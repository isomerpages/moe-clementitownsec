Our C Division Volleyball Boys did the school proud by clinching the 3rd position in the recent West Zone Volleyball Tournament. The boys recorded 3 straight wins against Yuhua Sec, Tanglin Sec and Nanhua High School to qualify for the Semi-Finals of the tournament. In the 3rd/4th placing game, the boys performed remarkably well, and took home the 3rd position after defeating Shuqun Secondary School with a score of 2-0.  

The team would like to thank the school leaders, teachers and the student supporters for their continuous support throughout the whole competition season.
