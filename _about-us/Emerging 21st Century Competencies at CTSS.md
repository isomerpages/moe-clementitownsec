<p>In Clementi Town Secondary School, we believe in equipping our students
with the knowledge, skills, and values necessary to navigate the complexities
of the 21st century. Guided by our motto, Aspire &amp; Grow, we are committed
to nurturing individuals who are resilient, forward-thinking, and ready
to thrive in an ever-changing world.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Our Commitment to E21CC</strong></h4>
<p>As a vibrant community of learners, we aim to empower our students with
Emerging 21st Century Competencies (E21CC),<strong> </strong>a set of essential
skills that prepare them for study, work, and life. These competencies
are increasingly important as students engage with a world that is dynamic,
interconnected, and full of new opportunities.</p>
<p>The E21CC are categorised into three key domains:</p>
<p>ðŸ”¹ <strong>Critical, Adaptive, and Inventive Thinking</strong> â€“ Encouraging
students to think critically, apply metacognitive strategies, and make
informed decisions. By fostering creativity and adaptability, we prepare
them to tackle uncertainties and solve problems innovatively.</p>

<p><em>CT Musicals are home-grown productions that instill empathy, respect, and love while showcasing the collaborative efforts of students, teachers, and alumni. Through scriptwriting, directing, choreography, and set design, students engage in critical thinking, problem-solving challenges in storytelling and stage execution.</em>

<p><em>CTSSâ€™ MARS Applied Learning Programme (ALP) nurtures critical, adaptive, and inventive thinking, preparing students to be future-ready with strong digital literacy. Through hands-on projects and research, students analyse problems and develop solutions. Their participation in events such as the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair 2025 encourages them to innovate and take ownership of their STEM learning.</em>

<p>ðŸ”¹ <strong>Communication, Collaboration, and Information Skills</strong> â€“
Equipping students with the ability to express themselves effectively,
work cohesively in teams, and manage information responsibly. In a digital
age, they learn to engage meaningfully with others and contribute ethically
in both online and offline spaces.</p>

<p>ðŸ”¹ <strong>Civic, Global, and Cross-cultural Literacy</strong> â€“ Cultivating
socially responsible individuals who contribute positively to their community
and beyond. Students develop respect, empathy, and integrity as they interact
