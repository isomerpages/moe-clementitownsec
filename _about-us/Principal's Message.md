<p>A very warm welcome to all our students, staff and parents as we begin
a new school year together. It is always a joy to see our school come alive
again with energy, purpose and the promise of new beginnings.</p>
<p>To our newest members — our Sec 1 Clementeens — welcome to the family!
This is an exciting milestone as you begin a new phase of your educational
journey. While the transition to secondary school may feel both thrilling
and daunting, please be assured that you will be well supported every step
of the way. Our teachers, staff and seniors are here to guide you, encourage
you and help you grow with confidence.</p>
<p>At Clementi Town Secondary School, we believe that school should be a
place of hope, especially amidst the complexities and uncertainties of
the world around us. Every child matter, and every student is valued for
their unique strengths, interests and potential. We are committed to creating
a nurturing environment where our students feel safe to learn, to try,
to grow and to become the best versions of themselves.</p>
<p>Our school is also a place where growth is intentionally cultivated. Through
meaningful learning experiences, strong relationships and purposeful programmes,
we seek to nurture our students holistically and enable them to realise
their potential — academically, socially and emotionally.</p>
<p>In the coming months, you will also see several upgrading works taking
place around the school. These enhancements are part of our continued efforts
to create more engaging, inspiring and future-ready learning spaces for
our students. We are excited about how these developments will further
enrich the school experience for everyone.</p>
<p>Finally, we look forward to working in close partnership with our parents.
Your trust, encouragement and collaboration are invaluable as we support
each child’s learning journey together. When school and home walk hand
in hand, our students are best positioned to thrive.</p>
<p>Let us step into the year ahead with optimism, purpose and a shared commitment
to helping every Clementeen aspire, grow and shine.</p>
<p>Educating with you,
<br>Rasidah Binte Rahim
<br>Principal
<br>Clementi Town Secondary School</p>
