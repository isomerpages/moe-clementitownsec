Welcome to Clementi Town Secondary School (CTSS)!

             I am excited to join the school and look forward to get to know all parents and partner you in your child’s learning journey. CTSS has come a long way since it was first established in 1980. Through the years, the school has grown in strength and led to many good stories among its students. All this would not have been possible without the collective effort of a dedicated team of teachers, supportive parents and committed learners. As I lead the school from 2022, I look forward to tapping on my prior stint at the Ministry of Education headquarter and school postings to build on the good work of my predecessors.

          Our **school motto** **‘Aspire & Grow’** captures the spirit of CTSS to aim high and grow as a progressive school which makes a positive difference to the community. This is translated through many of our key initiatives such as our Applied Learning Programme which focuses on developing computational thinking through coding, Lifelong Learning Programme with an emphasis on servant leadership, our unique approach to Full Subject Based Banding (FSBB), National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP), and many others.      

  

             We strive to provide our students with a holistic and engaging learning experience as we seek to nurture all Clementeens to have a heart for others while at the same time aim for excellence as they journey with us in the next 4 or 5 years. This is encapsulated in our **school vision, ‘To be a vibrant community of learners, with the heart to value every individual and the spirit to serve and to excel’** and our **school’s ASPIRE values** (which stand for **A**daptability, **S**elf-discipline, **P**erseverance, **I**ntegrity, **R**espect, **E**mpathy). The school vision and values resonate strongly with me because I believe that school is a microcosm of the society, it is thus important for us to equip our students with the relevant knowledge, lifelong competencies and right values when they are with us so that they can become active, contributing members of the community, making positive impact in the future. This will help to develop the gracious society that we all envision for.

          In CTSS, we believe that Clementeens are unpolished gems with different starting points. Each one of them has a unique set of strengths and potential. With hard work, effort, self-discipline and belief in themselves, there is no limit to what they can achieve in the future. Therefore as a team, we strive **‘To develop in every Clementeen the passion to learn, the confidence to lead, and the humility to serve’.** We hope at the end their learning journey with us, our students will graduate as diamonds shining with their own unique brilliance. Not only in their lives but also the lives of others.

          As we move towards 2022 and beyond, I look forward to your support to partner us to develop every Clementeen to be a polished diamond.

Educating our Clementeens with you,

Mdm Rasidah Rahim
