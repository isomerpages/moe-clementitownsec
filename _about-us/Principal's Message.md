<p>Welcome back to a new academic year at Clementi Town Secondary School (CTSS)! It is with immense pleasure that I extend a warm welcome to our new Secondary 1 students and their parents, and equally, welcome back our returning students. I trust that the Nov/Dec break has been a time of rejuvenation and excitement for the learning journey that awaits us.</p><p>Reflecting on the achievements of 2023 fills me with pride and gratitude. Our Clementeens have excelled in various aspects of their learning, both in academic and non-academic pursuits, showcasing their holistic growth. It is heartening to witness the dedication and enthusiasm with which they approached challenges, contributing to the vibrant and dynamic spirit of our school community.</p><p>As we embark on this new chapter, I encourage all students to embrace and exercise greater student agency. The benefits of fostering greater learner agency are numerous. When students take an active role in their education, they become more motivated to learn for life. This sense of ownership leads to increased engagement, deeper understanding, and a genuine passion for acquiring knowledge.</p><p>Coupled with a growth mindset, which has been a cornerstone of our educational philosophy, students can achieve incredible personal and academic growth in the coming year. A growth mindset encourages resilience, perseverance, and a willingness to take on challenges as opportunities for learning and improvement.</p><p>I also want to emphasize the importance of curiosity. Cultivating a curious mindset can spark creativity and innovation. Curiosity is the driving force behind exploration, critical thinking, and a lifelong love for learning. I encourage each student to ask questions, seek answers, and explore the wonders of knowledge with a curious spirit.</p><p>As we step into this new academic year, let us continue to foster a supportive and collaborative learning environment. Our school is a community of learners, and together, we can achieve remarkable things. I am excited about the potential for growth, discovery, and success that this year holds for each and every one of our Clementeens.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Educating with you,</p><p>Rasidah Binte Rahim<br>Principal<br>Clementi Town Secondary School</p><p><br><br><br></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:95%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="banner awards" src="/images/banner_awards_.png"></div><p></p>
