<p>As we step into 2025, I am filled with optimism and excitement for the
year ahead. The past year, 2024, has been a fulfilling one for our school
as we embarked on the ICT Masterplan 2030. This initiative saw our teachers
exploring innovative teaching pedagogies, which enriched classroom experiences
and made learning more engaging for our students. These efforts reflect
our unwavering commitment to providing a holistic and future-ready education
for every learner.</p>
<p>This year, we are delighted to welcome 8 new classes of Secondary One
student to our school community. To our newest members, we extend our warmest
greetings and look forward to journeying with you as you embark on this
exciting phase of your education.</p>
<p>As we chart our path forward, we remain steadfast in nurturing 21st-century
competencies in our students. These include fostering student agency, cultivating
a growth mindset, and empowering our students to view challenges and failures
as opportunities for learning and personal growth. We aim to equip them
with the resilience and adaptability they need to thrive in a rapidly evolving
world.</p>
<p>We are also excited about the upcoming improvement works to our school
environment, which will enhance our learning spaces and make it a more
vibrant and inspiring place for all. Importantly, we value student voice
and will actively involve our students in shaping these enhancements. This
collaborative effort will further strengthen their sense of ownership and
pride in our school.</p>
<p>Another significant highlight this year will be our schoolâ€™s 45th Anniversary
Celebrations. Through a series of meaningful activities and programs, we
will honor our rich heritage, celebrate our achievements, and envision
our shared future.</p>
<p>Finally, our partnership with parents remains a cornerstone of our success.
We deeply value the trust and collaboration of our parents as we work together
to support our students in realizing their fullest potential. By building
strong home-school partnerships, we can ensure that every child is empowered
to grow, excel, and shine.</p>
<p>Let us make 2025 a memorable and impactful year for our school community.</p>
<p>Educating with you,
<br>Rasidah Binte Rahim
