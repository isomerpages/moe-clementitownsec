<p>Our school was one of the Phase 1 schools which started offering Subject-Based
Banding (SBB) in 2017. With SBB, students who offer most subjects at G1
or G2 are given the opportunities to offer subjects at a more demanding
level from the start of Secondary One if they have performed well in these
subjects at the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). This allows
students to build a stronger foundation in subjects that they are good
at, nurture their strengths and give them more opportunities throughout
their educational journey, so that they are more engaged in learning.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Eligibility Criteria for SBB</strong>
</p>
<p>Eligible students can offer <u>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and Sciences</u> at
a more demanding level based on their PSLE AL for each subject.</p>

<p><strong>Other Opportunities to Participate in SBB</strong>
</p>
<p>For students who did not meet the eligibility criteria for SBB at the
start of Secondary One, they can still be considered for SBB if they do
well in their learning in Secondary One.</p>
<p>Beyond the start of Secondary One, students may offer subjects at a more
demanding level, based on their performance and schools’ holistic assessment.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Coping with More Demanding Level Subjects</strong>
</p>
<p>The Lower Secondary curriculum is to be seen as a two-year block.&nbsp;Students
are encouraged to continue with the subjects at more demanding level until
the end of Secondary Two, as students need time to adjust to the different
academic demands.</p>
<p>Our school will monitor the students’ progress in the more demanding level
subjects and their overall progress in all subjects to evaluate if the
student is ready to continue the subject at more demanding level at Upper
Secondary.</p>
