<p>We are pleased to announce the award won by our Clementeens at the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair 2023:<br><br>*SSEF 2023 Bronze Award*: How the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 reprograms cellular metabolism and the DNA damage response<br>- Eryn Lim Zhi Yan S4-Guzheng<br>- Teng Jia Yu S3-NCDCC<br>- Chng Choon Hoe Hugh S3-Wushu<br><br>We remember the journey and all its ups and downs because we know that the process is more important than the product and that courage is not the absence of fear. We are very happy that we continued and persevered despite several personal journeys and we learnt that together, we can overcome seemingly insurmountable odds, despite how clich√© it sounds.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SSEF2023.jpeg"></div><p></p>
