<p>On 10 May, five of our Clementeens took part in Unity Secondary School's
Young Writers Festival. After having submitted their original flash-fiction
and poetry pieces for the competition, our students participated in various
fringe activities, watched the recital of winning entries and engaged in
a breakout session with the judges, who were local poets and authors.</p>
<p>Jason Fong Ka Seng (S4-AC) emerged as one of the prize winners (2nd Prize)
for the event with his poem</p>
<p>"Consequences of Wishing Upon a Star"! The judges commended his piece
for interesting use of form and the depth of language!</p>
<p>Congratulations Jason, as well as our other student writers - Darwisyah
Nabilah, AJ Callie Jeffrey, Dylan Tay and Sophie Ong!</p>
