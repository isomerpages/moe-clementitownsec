<p>Held at the National Science Museum in Pathum Thani, Thailand, the Ministry
of Education proudly hosted the ASEAN Youth Camp 2025 (AYC 2025) â€” a vibrant
showcase of young minds across ASEAN, China, Japan, South Korea, and Timor-Leste.
Under the theme "Al for Green Sustainability," 17 teams from 13 countries
came together to present cutting-edge solutions tackling pressing environmental
challenges - from clean energy and waste management to natural resource
conservation and climate change adaptation.</p>
<p>The event featured a spirited competition judged by an international panel
of experts from Germany, the UK, Australia, Finland, Spain, UNESCO (Bangkok),
and the SEAMEO STEM-ED Center. Projects were assessed based on their innovation,
systems thinking, and real-world feasibility.</p>
<p>Team Singapore from Clementi Town Secondary School made the nation proud
by clinching the 2nd Runner-Up Award in the Al Hackathon Challenge and
1st Runner-Up Award in the CiRA Robotics Challenge.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the team members, led by Mr Chidambaram Saravanan,
for their outstanding achievement and inspiring efforts in building a greener
future.</p>
