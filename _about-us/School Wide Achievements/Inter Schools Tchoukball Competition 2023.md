<p>A group of Tchoukball students participated in the Inter-Schools Tchoukball Competition on 25th April and we are proud to share that they have come in 2nd for the Plate category!</p><p>Although CTSS has no Tchoukball CCA, this group of boys (from 6 different CCAs) had expressed interest in representing CTSS after having gone through the Tchoukball module when they were in Sec 3 last year, and had restarted training at their own time in Term 2 in preparation for the competition.</p><p>Congratulations, Tchoukball boys!</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Tchoukball.jpeg"></div><p></p>
