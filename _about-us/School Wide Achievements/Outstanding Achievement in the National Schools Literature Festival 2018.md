The National Schools Literature Festival is an annual literary festival for secondary school students aimed at promoting and cultivating a love for the subject.  
  
This year, our school sent a total of eight teams of students from Secondary One to Secondary Four to participate in various events. Our Secondary Three Express, Four Express and Four Normal (Academic) teams won their Unseen Debate and another Secondary Three Express team won their Set Text Debate.
