Lyrics by **Mrs Lee Hong Leong** and **Miss Ho Swee Yin**

Music by **Mr John De Souza**

We are one big family

In Clementi Town Secondary

With a true spirit and with zeal

Diligence and loyalty

Together we grow in wisdom, strength and unity

#### **CHORUS**

Clementi Town Secondary

We pledge to uphold your name

From each his best and yet as one

We'll strive to aspire and grow

(Repeat)

In all endeavours we’ll work hard

In lessons or sports or in music

Skills and good traits to be acquired

Not forgetting humility

For country and nation –

We'll serve in peace and harmony
