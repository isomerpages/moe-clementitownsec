We conducted a parents engagement session titled "Using Technology for Learning by Teenagers â€“ How Parents Can Better Support and Connect with Them?" on Saturday, 4 March 2023. There were rich sharing on the Self-Directed Learning as well as the use of the Device Management Application (DMA) to promote productive use of the iPADs by students.
