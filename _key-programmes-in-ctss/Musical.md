<p>The CT Musical journey began in 2009, with the Literature class’ wish
to present on stage the text they had felt strongly for, <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>.
The ground-up production saw the devotion of both alumni and then-current
students, and the show was staged in the school hall after four months
of preparation. The journey had taught the students strong lessons of empathy,
respect and love, and reinforced the school values of adaptability and
self-discipline. Recognising the power of drama to train the soft skills
and adversity quotient required to help our students navigate their way
about the VUCA world and having witnessed the strong bonds built between
alumni and current students with the production, the school began the CT
musical tradition, and we have put up eight musicals that are open to all
students to audition, since our first.
<br>
<br>CT Musicals are ‘home-grown’ productions that continue to emphasise on
the values of empathy, respect and love. They speak of the efforts of students
and teachers (script, directing, song arrangement, choreography, set and
props design) and alumni (acting, dance choreography, song-writing). Students
take on various leadership roles such as Stage Manager, Production Manager,
Wardrobe Mistress and Dance Choreographer, and are taught humility and
respect, as they see how each person, cast or crew, is crucial to the show.
Since 2012, the performance is put up in June, and the students undergo
a six-month preparation for the final show. The students learn how to manage
situations and learn to improvise, learn to look out for one another, and
develop a strong sense of responsibility and belonging.&nbsp;While the
students could not stage a show during the pandemic, the team was determined
to bring the show online, and for 2021, CTSS put up an interactive piece
using Zoom.</p>
<p>In 2024, CTSS restaged ‘Dear You’, which was first put up in 2014, as
a tenth-year anniversary celebration. The cast and crew members of ‘Dear
You’ 2014 returned to help in the production, guiding their juniors in
their roles for the show.</p>
