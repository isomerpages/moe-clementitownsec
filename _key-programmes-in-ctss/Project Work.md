#### **RATIONALE FOR PROJECT WORK**

  
The world our students live in is a dynamic one in which they must continually keep abreast with changes and new developments. In the 21st century, globalization, changing demographics and technological advancements are some of the key driving forces. Students should be equipped to face these challenges and seize them when these opportunities are presented. An important attribute students must develop is the versatility to transfer ideas from one context to another and make creative connections between them. The continual self-examination of their own performance is also important if they are to attain high standards in their respective fields. Increasingly, students are also expected to collaborate with their peers and communicate their ideas effectively to achieve a common objective.
