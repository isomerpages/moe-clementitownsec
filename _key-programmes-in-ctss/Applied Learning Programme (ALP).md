<h4><strong>MASTERY THROUGH APPLICATION AND RESEARCH IN STEM (MARS)</strong></h4>
<p>Clementi Town Secondary School offers its ALP programme abbreviated MARS
under the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) strand
and seeks to develop our students to be Future-ready Clementeens who possess
digital literacy and are architects of their own STEM learning.</p>
<p>The ALP framework reflects the emphasis on developing Science, Technology,
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) skills in our students, in addition
to Thinking, Collaborative and Communications skills.</p>

</div>
<p>The objectives of MARS are to provide opportunities for Clementeens to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>foster <strong>curiosity</strong> and <strong>creativity</strong>, and promote <strong>innovation</strong> in <strong>STEM</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>actively engage in <strong>problem-solving processes</strong> and apply <strong>investigative techniques</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>explore pursuits that spark interest in the <strong>Digital and Green Economy</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establish <strong>meaningful connections between different subjects</strong> and
grasp the <strong>practical significance of STEM </strong>and <strong>Emerging Technologies</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cultivate <strong>21st-century competencies</strong> through authentic experiences
and <strong>hands-on learning</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of applied learning, programmes have been designed to enable students
to work through problems in groups and to come up with practical solutions
and real products. This authentic and hands-on approach would provide additional
platforms for our Clementeens to practice 21st century skills such as creative
problem solving, team work and analytical thinking and also turn our Clementeens
from passive consumers into active producers of technology.</p>
<p>The MARS Curriculum caters to the diverse needs and aspirations of STEM
learning of our students.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 1 - Integrated of STEM in the Lower Secondary English Language, Mathematics and Science Curricula</strong>
</p>
<p>STEM-related skills and content knowledge, aligned to the&nbsp;STEM ALP
Emerging Technologies Contextualised Themes, will be integrated in the
Lower Secondary English Language, Mathematics and Science curriculum (ALP
Tier 1) that exposes students to&nbsp;applied pedagogy, real world applications
and develops in our students’ Computational Thinking, Problem-solving,
Collaborative, Communications,&nbsp;Numerical Literacy &amp; Data Analysis
skills.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 2 – Workshops, Enrichment Courses and Competitions</strong>
</p>
<p>Students who have displayed an interest to explore STEM-related activities
at a deeper level would be given the opportunity to participate in Workshops,
Enrichment Courses and Competitions, such as Science-in-Action Research
Mentorship Programme, AI for Youth Programme, AI for Everyone Programme
and Computing Talent Development Programme.</p>

<p><strong>Who are we?</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A <strong>research mentorship programme</strong> that cultivates Sec 2/3
students the <strong>spirit of inquiry</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students will work on a <strong>year-long research project</strong> under
the mentorship of a teacher or an expert from tertiary institutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throughout the project, students will engage in <strong>hands-on laboratory experiments </strong>and
delve deeper into <strong>theoretical aspects of biology</strong> that go
beyond the typical school curriculum</p>

<p>Seventeen Secondary 3 Clementeens participated in the Clementi Town Secondary
- Hwa Chong Institution Computing Exchange programme from 13 to 15 May
2024. During this workshop, our students learnt Ehical Hacking while establishing
collaborations with their peers from Hwa Chong Institution.</p>

<p><strong>National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI) 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>NOI is a computing competition organized by National University of Singapore.
It is an annual nation-wide programming competition that aims to provide
our best students the ultimate challenge in computing and programming and
is open to all current junior college and secondary school students.</p>

<p>Students participating in the National Olympiad in Informatics 2024</p>
<p>In NOI 2024, seventeen Computing students represented the school in the
competition, with six students making it to the Final Round. Nguyen Chi
Kien, from class S4-DC, was awarded the&nbsp;<strong>Silver Medal</strong>&nbsp;for
his prowess in coding.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Computing Project</u>
</p>
<p>Computing students who were keen to work on a real-world computing project
were given the opportunity to first identify an authentic problem related
to their school experience and work on a solution to the problem.</p>
<p>Two of our students, Aidan Ong and Hu Bowen, have worked proactively and
tirelessly to identify a specific area of need by the school, whereby students
spend a significant amount of their recess and lunch periods queuing up
to purchase their food, and developed a canteen queue wait time estimator,
through the use of OpenCV for image processing and the YOLOv5 vision model,
to programme a Raspberry Pi microcontroller with a video camera attachment
to identify the number of students in a queue. Information from the microcontroller
would then be transmitted wirelessly to a server through socket programming
and a client-server architecture, which allows an estimated queue time
to be shown on a screen.</p>

project.</p>
<p><u>Participation in the Swift Accelerator&nbsp;Programme</u>
</p>
<p>The Swift Accelerator Programme is an intensive 180-hour programme in
which students who are talented in coding are trained to develop iOS apps
using the Swift coding language, leveraging on the principles of challenge
based learning, storytelling and design thinking. Only 50 students, aged
13 to 15, are selected for this programme.</p>
<p>In 2021, two Clementeens have successfully completed the Swift Accelerator
Programme. They presented their work at the Swift Innovators Summit Singapore
2022 on 16 March 2022, at Apple One North.</p>
<p>The students involved in the Swift Accelerator Programme 2021 are:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Nguyen Viet Truong (Bill), S4-MM (4B1)</strong>,&nbsp;along
with his teammates, have published an App called “StudyZone” which helps
students manage their incoming schoolwork. You may download the app via

<p><u>Participation in the First Lego League Competition</u>
</p>
<p>Students from the Multimedia Services Club, who showed an interest and
dedication to robotics, had participated in the&nbsp;First Lego League
(FLL) Competition 2021.This year, two teams from MMS took part in the FLL
competition for the first time. One of the teams won praise from the judges
for their creativity, understanding of robot mechanism, and applying sound
concepts of Physics in designing their robot. They were also nominated
for the “Rising Star Award” which is given out to schools participating
in the tournament for the first time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Industrial Visits and Learning Journeys</strong>
</p>
<p>To expose students to STEM careers at an early age, Industrial Visits
and Learning Journeys were conducted to organisations and STEM-related
events.</p>
