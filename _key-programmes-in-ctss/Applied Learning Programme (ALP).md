<h4><strong>MASTERY THROUGH APPLICATION AND RESEARCH IN STEM (MARS)</strong></h4>
<p>Clementi Town Secondary School offers its ALP programme abbreviated MARS
under the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) strand
and seeks to develop our students to be Future-ready Clementeens who possess
digital literacy and are architects of their own STEM learning.</p>
<p>The ALP framework reflects the emphasis on developing Science, Technology,
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) skills in our students, in addition
to Thinking, Collaborative and Communications skills.</p>

</div>
<p>The objectives of MARS are to provide opportunities for Clementeens to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>foster <strong>curiosity</strong> and <strong>creativity</strong>, and promote <strong>innovation</strong> in <strong>STEM</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>actively engage in <strong>problem-solving processes</strong> and apply <strong>investigative techniques</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>explore pursuits that spark interest in the <strong>Digital and Green Economy</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establish <strong>meaningful connections between different subjects</strong> and
grasp the <strong>practical significance of STEM </strong>and <strong>Emerging Technologies</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cultivate <strong>21st-century competencies</strong> through authentic experiences
and <strong>hands-on learning</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of applied learning, programmes have been designed to enable students
to work through problems in groups and to come up with practical solutions
and real products. This authentic and hands-on approach would provide additional
platforms for our Clementeens to practice 21st century skills such as creative
problem solving, team work and analytical thinking and also turn our Clementeens
from passive consumers into active producers of technology.</p>
<p>The MARS Curriculum caters to the diverse needs and aspirations of STEM
learning of our students.</p>

his prowess in coding.</p>
<p>In addition, two other Clementeens were awarded the Certificate of Participation
for solving some of the coding questions:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Hu Bowen, S4-NC (4B1)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nguyen Viet Truong (Bill), S4-MM (4B1)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Computing Project</u>
</p>
<p>Computing students who were keen to work on a real-world computing project
were given the opportunity to first identify an authentic problem related
to their school experience and work on a solution to the problem.</p>
<p>Two of our students, Aidan Ong and Hu Bowen, have worked proactively and
tirelessly to identify a specific area of need by the school, whereby students
spend a significant amount of their recess and lunch periods queuing up
to purchase their food, and developed a canteen queue wait time estimator,
through the use of OpenCV for image processing and the YOLOv5 vision model,
to programme a Raspberry Pi microcontroller with a video camera attachment
to identify the number of students in a queue. Information from the microcontroller
would then be transmitted wirelessly to a server through socket programming
and a client-server architecture, which allows an estimated queue time
to be shown on a screen.</p>

project.</p>
<p><u>Participation in the Swift Accelerator&nbsp;Programme</u>
</p>
<p>The Swift Accelerator Programme is an intensive 180-hour programme in
which students who are talented in coding are trained to develop iOS apps
using the Swift coding language, leveraging on the principles of challenge
based learning, storytelling and design thinking. Only 50 students, aged
13 to 15, are selected for this programme.</p>
