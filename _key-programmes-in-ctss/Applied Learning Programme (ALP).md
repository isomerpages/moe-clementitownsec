<h4><strong>MASTERY THROUGH APPLICATION AND RESEARCH IN STEM (MARS)</strong></h4>
<p>Clementi Town Secondary School offers its ALP programme abbreviated MARS
under the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) strand
and seeks to develop our students to be Future-ready Clementeens who possess
digital literacy and are architects of their own STEM learning.</p>
<p>The ALP framework reflects the emphasis on developing Science, Technology,
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) skills in our students, in addition
to Thinking, Collaborative and Communications skills.</p>

</div>
<p>The objectives of MARS are to provide opportunities for Clementeens to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>foster <strong>curiosity</strong> and <strong>creativity</strong>, and promote <strong>innovation</strong> in <strong>STEM</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>actively engage in <strong>problem-solving processes</strong> and apply <strong>investigative techniques</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>explore pursuits that spark interest in the <strong>Digital and Green Economy</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establish <strong>meaningful connections between different subjects</strong> and
grasp the <strong>practical significance of STEM </strong>and <strong>Emerging Technologies</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cultivate <strong>21st-century competencies</strong> through authentic experiences
and <strong>hands-on learning</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of applied learning, programmes have been designed to enable students
to work through problems in groups and to come up with practical solutions
and real products. This authentic and hands-on approach would provide additional
platforms for our Clementeens to practice 21st century skills such as creative
problem solving, team work and analytical thinking and also turn our Clementeens
from passive consumers into active producers of technology.</p>
<p>The MARS Curriculum caters to the diverse needs and aspirations of STEM
learning of our students.</p>

<p><u>CTSS-HCI Exchange Programme</u>
</p>
<p>Eighteen Secondary 3 Clementeens participated in the Augmented Reality/Virtual
Reality (AR/VR) Workshop organised by Hwa Chong Institution (HCI) on 17
and 18 May 2022. During this workshop, our students learnt how to create
Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality projects, while establishing collaborations
with their peers from Hwa Chong Institution.</p>

<p><u>AI Bootcamp</u>
</p>
<p>A 5-day Artificial Intelligence (AI) Bootcamp was organised during the
June Holidays to:
<br>provide Clementeens, who have demonstrated an interest and passion for
programming, the opportunity to develop deep technology skills for the
emergent fields of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
<br>further inspire and ignite our Clementeens' passion for Technology through
application of these skills in the field of Artificial Intelligence and
Machine Learning.</p>
<p>At the end of the bootcamp, participants created their own projects. Please
click on the image below to find out more about one of the AI projects
that was created upon completion of the bootcamp.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 3 – Participation in Olympiad Training, App Development Programmes, Mentorship Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>Tier 3 of the ALP is designed to provide opportunities for a few students
excelling in the field of computing to develop their talents. One such
Talent Development Programme is the intensive training in preparation for
the National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI).</p>
<p><u>National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI) 2022</u>
</p>
<p>NOI is a computing competition organized by National University of Singapore.
It is an annual nation-wide programming competition that aims to provide
our best students the ultimate challenge in computing and programming and
is open to all current junior college and secondary school students.</p>

<p>In NOI 2022, seven Computing students represented the school in the competition.
Aidan Ong, from class S4-NC (4B1), was awarded the&nbsp;<strong>Bronze Medal</strong>&nbsp;for
his prowess in coding.</p>
<p>In addition, two other Clementeens were awarded the Certificate of Participation
for solving some of the coding questions:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Hu Bowen, S4-NC (4B1)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nguyen Viet Truong (Bill), S4-MM (4B1)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Computing Project</u>
</p>
<p>Computing students who were keen to work on a real-world computing project
were given the opportunity to first identify an authentic problem related
to their school experience and work on a solution to the problem.</p>
<p>Two of our students, Aidan Ong and Hu Bowen, have worked proactively and
tirelessly to identify a specific area of need by the school, whereby students
spend a significant amount of their recess and lunch periods queuing up
to purchase their food, and developed a canteen queue wait time estimator,
through the use of OpenCV for image processing and the YOLOv5 vision model,
to programme a Raspberry Pi microcontroller with a video camera attachment
to identify the number of students in a queue. Information from the microcontroller
would then be transmitted wirelessly to a server through socket programming
and a client-server architecture, which allows an estimated queue time
to be shown on a screen.</p>

project.</p>
<p><u>Participation in the Swift Accelerator&nbsp;Programme</u>
</p>
<p>The Swift Accelerator Programme is an intensive 180-hour programme in
which students who are talented in coding are trained to develop iOS apps
using the Swift coding language, leveraging on the principles of challenge
based learning, storytelling and design thinking. Only 50 students, aged
13 to 15, are selected for this programme.</p>
<p>In 2021, two Clementeens have successfully completed the Swift Accelerator
Programme. They presented their work at the Swift Innovators Summit Singapore
2022 on 16 March 2022, at Apple One North.</p>
<p>The students involved in the Swift Accelerator Programme 2021 are:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Nguyen Viet Truong (Bill), S4-MM (4B1)</strong>,&nbsp;along
with his teammates, have published an App called “StudyZone” which helps
students manage their incoming schoolwork. You may download the app via

<p><u>Participation in the First Lego League Competition</u>
</p>
<p>Students from the Multimedia Services Club, who showed an interest and
dedication to robotics, had participated in the&nbsp;First Lego League
(FLL) Competition 2021.This year, two teams from MMS took part in the FLL
competition for the first time. One of the teams won praise from the judges
for their creativity, understanding of robot mechanism, and applying sound
concepts of Physics in designing their robot. They were also nominated
for the “Rising Star Award” which is given out to schools participating
in the tournament for the first time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Industrial Visits and Learning Journeys</strong>
</p>
<p>To expose students to STEM careers at an early age, Industrial Visits
and Learning Journeys were conducted to organisations and STEM-related
events.</p>
