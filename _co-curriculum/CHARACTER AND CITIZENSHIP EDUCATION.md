The CCE 2021 curriculum is based on the three big ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices. It involves the teaching and learning of core values and social-emotional competencies with a focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students. These fundamentals are taught and applied in the six curriculum content areas of CCE. In CTSS, we aspire to mould the character of every Clementeen so that they become active Clementeens with the passion to learn, bright Clementeens with the confidence to lead and caring Clementeens with the humility to serve.

**Highly Effective Youths (HEY)** <br>
The school approaches the teaching of social-emotional competencies through a customised school-based CCE curriculum based on the ‘7 habits for Highly Effective Youths’ by Stephen Covey. It is hoped that these habits, which are a result of a set of attitudes, underpinned by values, will be exemplified in positive behaviours and become a way of life for students.  
  
The 7 Habits programme aims to develop every Clementeen towards being an effective individual and a team player. The 7 habits programme is also integrated into the school’s Life Learning Programme, with students exercising personal leadership in how they lead their lives and interact with their peers. These habits are taught in the CCE lessons and actively applied in students’ school experiences such as in school camps, CCAs and academic lessons.  

**National Education (NE)**  
National Education is an integral part of the school’s Citizenship Education programme. With its vision of ‘Every Clementeen, An Active and Global Citizen’, the NE programme aims to nurture active and concerned citizens with the passion to learn, confidence to lead and humility to serve.  
  
One of the key signature events are the NE Aspire Trail which is an NE trail around the school customised by the NE ambassadors with the intent of inducting Sec 1 students into the rich school history and heritage so that they would be responsible members of the big CTSS family. This NE Trail draws on knowledge and information from the CTSS virtual heritage museum.  
  
**Sexuality Education**  
  
The Sexuality Education module aims to help students develop a moral compass, respect for themselves and others through making wise, responsible and informed decisions based on positive mainstream values and attitudes. Besides decision-making skills, students are taught to manage their thoughts, feelings and behaviours on human sexuality through effective communication and problem-solving skills  
  

**Mental Health**

CTSS focuses on developing resilience through raising awareness of mental health issues, strategies to cope with stress and distress and strengthening a positive outlook about life. The school also taps on the Peer-Support-Leaders programme where buddies offer social and emotional support to students in need.  

**Education and Career Guidance (ECG)**  

To help foster a confident 21st century person ready for the work force, Education and Career Guidance module helps students to develop their social and emotional competencies; discover their interests, strengths and weakness; and also explore their career choices. CTSS organizes career fest, polytechnic course tasters and learning journeys to post-secondary institutions to help students make informed decisions regarding their tertiary education.

  

ECG Counsellor, Mr Damon Choo, is in school every Tuesday to provide ECG counselling services. Students who wish to explore more about post-secondary options or find out more about their career interests and strengths may drop him an email at [choo_soon_heng@schools.gov.sg](mailto:choo_soon_heng@schools.gov.sg) to book a session.
