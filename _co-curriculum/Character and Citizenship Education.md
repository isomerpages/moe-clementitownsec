Every Clementeen, An Active Citizen of Character  
  
# CURRICULUM CONTENT

In CTSS, we aspire to mould the character of every Clementeen so that they become active Clementeens with the passion to learn, the confidence to lead and the humility to serve. The design of the school’s CCE Curriculum takes reference from MOE’s CCE 2021 Curriculum Frame and is anchored on the school’s values, vision and mission.

# **CCE Lessons**

Character and Citizenship Education (CCE),which includes National Education (NE) and Social and Emotional Learning (SEL), are integral to the holistic development of our students so that they lead purposeful lives. It involves the teaching and learning of core values and social-emotional competencies, with a focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students. These fundamentals are taught and applied in the six curriculum content areas of CCE, namely Education and Career Guidance, Cyber Wellness, National Education, Sexuality Education, Mental Health and Family Education.&nbsp;

Contemporary issues are also discussed during CCE lessons to develop active citizenry, critical thinking skills and global awareness among students. Through guided facilitation and class discussions, Clementeens will learn the important skill of perspective taking in a wide range of themes and issues that are relevant to their development and life experiences.
















KEY PROGRAMMES

The CCE 2021 curriculum is based on the three big ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices. It involves the teaching and learning of core values and social-emotional competencies with a focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students. These fundamentals are taught and applied in the six curriculum content areas of CCE. In CTSS, we aspire to mould the character of every Clementeen so that they become active Clementeens with the passion to learn, bright Clementeens with the confidence to lead and caring Clementeens with the humility to serve.

**Highly Effective Youths (HEY)** <br>
The school approaches the teaching of social-emotional competencies through a customised school-based CCE curriculum based on the ‘7 habits for Highly Effective Youths’ by Stephen Covey. It is hoped that these habits, which are a result of a set of attitudes, underpinned by values, will be exemplified in positive behaviours and become a way of life for students.  
  
The 7 Habits programme aims to develop every Clementeen towards being an effective individual and a team player.&nbsp;The 7 habits programme is also integrated into the school’s Life Learning Programme, with students exercising personal leadership in how they lead their lives and interact with their peers. These habits are taught in the CCE lessons and actively applied in students’ school experiences such as in school camps, CCAs and academic lessons.  

**National Education (NE)**  
National Education is an integral part of the school’s Citizenship Education programme. With its vision of ‘Every Clementeen, An Active and Global Citizen’, the NE programme aims to nurture active and concerned citizens with the passion to learn, confidence to lead and humility to serve.  
  
One of the key signature events are the NE Aspire Trail which is an NE trail around the school customised by the NE ambassadors with the intent of inducting Sec 1 students into the rich school history and heritage so that they would be responsible members of the big CTSS family. This NE Trail draws on knowledge and information from the CTSS virtual heritage museum.  
  
**Sexuality Education**  
  
The Sexuality Education module aims to help students develop a moral compass, respect for themselves and others through making wise, responsible and informed decisions based on positive mainstream values and attitudes. Besides decision-making skills, students are taught to manage their thoughts, feelings and behaviours on human sexuality through effective communication and problem-solving skills  
  

**Mental Health**

CTSS focuses on developing resilience through raising awareness of mental health issues, strategies to cope with stress and distress and strengthening a positive outlook about life. The school also taps on the Peer-Support-Leaders programme where buddies offer social and emotional support to students in need.  

**Education and Career Guidance (ECG)**  

To help foster a confident 21st century person ready for the work force, Education and Career Guidance module helps students to develop their social and emotional competencies; discover their interests, strengths and weakness; and also explore their career choices. CTSS organizes career fest, polytechnic course tasters and learning journeys to post-secondary institutions to help students make informed decisions regarding their tertiary education.

  

ECG Counsellor, Mr Damon Choo, is in school every Tuesday to provide ECG counselling services. Students who wish to explore more about post-secondary options or find out more about their career interests and strengths may drop him an email at&nbsp;[choo_soon_heng@schools.gov.sg](mailto:choo_soon_heng@schools.gov.sg) to book a session.&nbsp;

**Family Education**

Lessons in Family Education raise awareness about what makes families resilient and ways teenagers can take to contribute to family life.

The school also regularly organize parenting talk to improve the relationship between parents and their children. Such partnerships are crucial in helping students thrive both in school and at home.

  

**Values-in-Action**  
  
Other than the six content areas, the Values-in-Action programme @ CTSS also provide opportunities for students to reach out to the community and serve.&nbsp; Such acts of service inculcate in Clementeens the humility to serve. Students also get grow in knowledge about the needs of the school and the community and to work in teams for the greater good of the community. All students are required to take part in or plan and execute at least one VIA project annually.
