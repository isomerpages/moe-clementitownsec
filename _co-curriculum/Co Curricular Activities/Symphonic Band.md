<h4><strong>ABOUT THE CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Clementi Town Symphonic Band, also known as CT Winds, started in the 1980s
with humble beginnings. It has since grown to its current 75-member strong
status. CTWinds has never failed to impress audiences with their performances
held both locally and internationally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 2015, CTWinds has attained the Certificate of Distinction for the
Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation for Concert Band (Secondary).
For 2019, other than clinching warm accolades for their performance during
SYF, the band had the privilege to perform at the Esplanade: Limelight
Series.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With an established Band Program, CTWinds Bandsmen learn and hone technical
skills on their instruments. The bandsmen attend leadership seminars to
hone their leadership skills. Through the program, Bandsmen cultivate discipline,
self-confidence and a sense of appreciation for the Aesthetics.</p>
