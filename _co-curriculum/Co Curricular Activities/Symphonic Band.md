#### **ABOUT THE CCA**

Clementi Town Symphonic Band, also known as CT Winds, started in the 1980s with humble beginnings. It has since grown to its current 75-member strong status. CTWinds has never failed to impress audiences with their performances held both locally and internationally.&nbsp;

Since 2015, CTWinds has attained the Certificate of Distinction for the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation for Concert Band (Secondary). For 2019, other than clinching warm accolades for their performance during SYF, the band had the privilege to perform at the Esplanade: Limelight Series.&nbsp;

With an established Band Program, CTWinds Bandsmen learn and hone technical skills on their instruments. The bandsmen attend leadership seminars to hone their leadership skills. Through the program, Bandsmen cultivate discipline, self-confidence and a sense of appreciation for the Aesthetics.
