<h4><strong>ABOUT THE CCA</strong></h4>
<p>In Modern Dance, dancers dance to express themselves and connect with
others, making every performance feel like a celebration of creativity
and passion. Dancers use spontaneous movements from Street Dance Styles
like Waacking, Hip Hop, House and Open Choreography to express feelings
and ideas allowing for a greater range of motion and physicality. Believing
every dancer is a leader, we hope to work on improving and developing the
strength of each dancer. Building resilience and self-confidence, dancers
learn and bond through teamwork and participating in performances.</p>
