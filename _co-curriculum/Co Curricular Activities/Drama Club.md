#### **ABOUT THE CCA**


CTSS Drama Club was established in 2010, with three official Secondary 1 members. The family was then formed with many passionate performers from the other levels, most of whom are second-CCA members. The club went for its first SYF in 2011, clinching Gold in the Central Judging that year. The club has also aided in the production of many CTSS' Musicals: “A 'West Side' Story” in 2012, “Dear You” in 2014, "What I Would Give" in 2016, "Where Did You Go?" in 2018, and “REPLAY” in 2022. The family has now grown to over 70 members, and the students are trained in crew work, stage management, acting, dancing, and even singing.
