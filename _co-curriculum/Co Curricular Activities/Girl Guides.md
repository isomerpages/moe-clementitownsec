<h4><strong>ABOUT THE CCA</strong></h4>
<p>The CTSS 1st Coy aims to provide the girls with the opportunity for self-training
in their personal character development, towards the realization of responsible
citizenship and promotion of service to the community. We learn skills
like outdoor cooking, tent-pitching and gadgets making. Through various
activities, the girls are able to adapt quickly, and also put what skills
they had learnt to good use. We also have courses on first-aid, enabling
us to be well-prepared to handle any emergency situation at any time.</p>
