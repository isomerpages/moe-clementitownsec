#### **ABOUT THE CCA**

  
The CTSS 1st Coy aims to provide the girls with the opportunity for self-training in their personal character development, towards the realization of responsible citizenship and promotion of service to the community. We learn skills like outdoor cooking, tent-pitching and gadgets making. Through various activities, the girls are able to adapt quickly, and also put what skills they had learnt to good use. We also have courses on first-aid, enabling us to be well-prepared to handle any emergency situation at any time.
