#### **ABOUT THE CCA**

Clementi Town Secondary Badminton Team consists of a group of like-minded individuals with a passion for the sport. We seek to develop well-rounded athletes, who not only excel in both sports and studies, but also have strength in character and top-notch sportsmanship. To achieve this, we provide a rigorous weekly training routine, designed to develop skills, strength and mental toughness, so that each team member is pushed to achieve their potential.&nbsp;

<p style="text-align:center;"> <strong>“Ability is what you are capable of doing. Motivation determines what you do. Attitude determines how well you do it.”</strong></p>
