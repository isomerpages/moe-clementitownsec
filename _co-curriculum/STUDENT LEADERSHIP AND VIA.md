Grounded in the belief that every Clementeen has the potential to be a leader, the leadership development is deployed down to every student.  There is a three-level student leadership development framework proposed to equip student leaders with the appropriate level of competencies to prepare them for leadership roles.

KEY PROGRAMMES
--------------

  
**Self-Leadership**  
All Students are required to undergo the Highly Effective Youth programme and achieve NYAA bronze at the end of secondary 2.  
  
**Team Leadership**  
CCA Leaders (No. 1), NE Ambassadors, Sports Leaders, Class Management Committee  
  
**Organizational Leadership**  
All Heads from the team leadership group (except CMC), Student Council    
  
The Leadership Challenge Model by James Kouzes and Barry Posner was adopted as the guiding model for the Student Leadership Framework.  This model advocated leadership grounded in values and aligned to the servant leader philosophy.    
  
The approach to develop the leaders’ competencies at each level includes teaching students 5 leadership practices.    

*   Model the way   
    
*   Inspire a Shared Vision   
    
*   Challenge the process   
    
*   Enable others to act   
    
*   Encourage the heart      
    

  
 In CTSS, we provide different leadership opportunities to cater to the different needs of students.
