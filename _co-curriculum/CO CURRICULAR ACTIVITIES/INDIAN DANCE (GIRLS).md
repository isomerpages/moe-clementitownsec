ABOUT THE CCA
-------------

Indian Dance has 40 years of rich history in Clementi Town Secondary School. In our school, we mainly focus on Classical Indian Dance called Bharathanatyam. This dance form has a rich ancient and cultural history to it. Dance allows our dancers to integrate their thinking, movement and feelings and also connect back to their cultural roots.

Indian Dancers are given opportunities to express themselves through this dance form on several stages such as Singapore Youth Festival, Inter-School Competitions, and performances for school and community events. With these opportunities provided, the Indian Dancers develop a higher level of self-awareness and confidence at the end of their school years here.

Our dancers are involved in Value in Action (VIA) community events as well, where they engage in meaningful activities. Students are given opportunities to also try out and watch performances of other dance forms where they learn to show appreciation towards other cultures.
