ABOUT THE CCA
-------------

  
CTSS Drama Club was established in 2010, with three official Secondary 1 members. The family was then formed with many passionate performers from the other levels, most of whom are second-CCA members. The club went for its first SYF in 2011, clinching Gold in the Central Judging that year. The club had aided in the production of CTSS' 3rd and 4th Musicals, “A 'West Side' Story” in 2012, “Dear You” in 2014, "What I Would Give" in 2016 and "Where Did You Go?" in 2018. The family has now grown to over 50 members, and the students are exposed to event management, acting, dancing and singing training.
