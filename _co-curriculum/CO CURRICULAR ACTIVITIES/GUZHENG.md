ABOUT THE CCA
-------------

Guzheng Ensemble was established in 2000. The Guzheng Ensemble has brought glory and honour to the school by successes such as winning Gold Award (2009 and 2013) at the Singapore Youth Festivals. In addition to preparing for the Singapore Youth Festival, the Guzheng Ensemble has staged many school and public performances.

In addition, our members also have the opportunity to gain nationally recognized music certificates in the playing of the Guzheng. This motivates many of the students to continue their love and appreciation of the culture and tradition of our rich musical heritage.
