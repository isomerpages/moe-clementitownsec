ABOUT THE CCA
-------------

  

In 2021, we marked the start of a new chapter as the school witness the formation of a new uniform group known as National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC). Building upon our past experiences with St. John Brigade, we aim to value add our students’ CCA journey by providing opportunities for students to learn life-saving skills beyond first aid.

NCDCC believes in developing and empowering our youths to be active &amp; concerned citizens with life-saving skills. Our curriculum focuses in developing greater awareness of civil defence in our cadets and prepare them with the skills to respond effectively to emergencies at home and abroad.

NCDCC’s motto of “We Learn, We Lead, We Serve”, in alignment to the 3 big ideas in Character and Citizenship Education: “Identity, Relationships and Choices”, well encapsulates the journey of NCDCC cadets into three phases:

1.  **We Learn:**&nbsp;Cadets learn Triangle of Life skills, which include basic firefighting, first aid and CPR+AED. These are core skills in NCDCC, which enable cadets to help themselves and others in times of need. Equipping cadets with these skills will help to form their identity as NCDCC cadets, a community responder at heart.
2.  **We Lead:**&nbsp;Cadets will be trained in soft skills such as leadership, communication (including methods of instruction), relationship management and social awareness to get them ready for their leadership phase. They will also further hone their civil defence skills by going through one of the three cadet specialist tracks and be given leadership opportunities to lead their peers.
3.  **We Serve:**&nbsp;Cadets will make choices to serve their school and the wider community through public education platforms such as the NCDCC Service Month and Emergency Preparedness Day as advocates of Emergency Preparedness. With the civil defence knowledge and skills imparted to them, they will also be able to lend a helping hand as Community First Responders with a compassionate heart.
