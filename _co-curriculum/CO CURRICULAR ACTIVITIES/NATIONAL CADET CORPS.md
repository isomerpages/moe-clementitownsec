ABOUT THE CCA
-------------

  

In NCC, we aim to develop resourceful, responsible, resilient, loyal leaders and team players through fun and challenging military-related activities.

Our cadets are often exposed to many challenging leadership roles, which aid in their holistic leadership development to become independent students.&nbsp;

We believe in team work. Most activities are conducted in groups to harness every individual's strength.
