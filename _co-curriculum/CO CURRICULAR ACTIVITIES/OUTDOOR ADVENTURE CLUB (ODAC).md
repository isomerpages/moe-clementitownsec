ABOUT THE CCA
-------------

  

Formed in 2014, CT ODAC started out initially as an interest group with a focus on exposing students with sporting activities such as ultimate frisbee. Over the years, ODAC has grown to be a more closely-knit family to all. Through shared experiences in the outdoors such as weekly hikes, cycling, high elements, kayaking, we provide a safe space for ODACians to discover more about their own strengths and limitations, and to develop the willingness to learn and grow.

With a refreshed motto&nbsp;Dream, Explore, Discover, we aspire to nurture ODACians to be open-minded individuals with the courage to step out of their comfort zones in pursuit of their dreams. Through outdoor adventure, our ODACians learn to be team players who are appreciative and respectful towards people around them and the environment. Here we believe that each ODACian has the ability and will to positively influence one’s own life and people around them. Through physical fitness, skill development, Values-in-Action projects, and various outdoor activities, ODAC provides an avenue to develop student agency – an invaluable skill that they can apply to their own lives.

As we embark on our next adventure, we endeavour our students to do so with a steadfast spirit, and most importantly, to do it&nbsp;together.
