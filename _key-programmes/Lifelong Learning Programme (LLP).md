KEY PROGRAMMES
--------------

**STUDENT LEADERS TRAINING**

The main objective of the training is to allow the Student Leaders, which comprises of the Student Council, National Education Ambassadors, Sports Leaders, CCA Leaders and Classroom Management Committee, to hone their leadership skills in order for them to serve the school and the community. Through the training, the Student Leaders develop leadership competencies by understanding the Leadership Challenge Model. In addition, they attend workshops such as conflict management and public speaking to build their individual leadership competencies. All of these equip student leaders with the necessary skills and knowledge to be better able to serve the school and external communities.   

**SEC 1 ASPIRE CAMP FACILITATOR’S TRAINING**

The ASPIRE CAMP is a pivotal event where different student leaders come together to organize an orientation program for the Secondary Ones. Through this camp, student leaders are mentored by Student Leadership teachers and Alumnus to develop their leadership.   

**ASPIRE CAMP Facilitators Training**

Students with leadership potential are identified by the teachers to be facilitators at the ASPIRE Camp. Training is provided to these Student Leaders for them to carry out their roles effectively at the camp. The objective of this training is to develop their confidence level in their ability to lead groups of students independently, school cheers and to be able to facilitate activities.  

**STUDENT COUNCIL**

The Student Council is made up of a group of students chosen to represent the student body to make decisions or give advice on student matters, and to run certain events or programmes for the school. They are the apex student organisation body.

**Peer Support Leaders**

Peer Support Leaders aim to cultivate a caring and supportive school community and advocate for cyber wellness, mental wellness and family education through various initiatives such as Animal Project, Mental Wellness Week and FamChamps. Our Peer Support Leaders learn knowledge and skills in the domains of peer bonding, peer helping and peer influencing so that they can be effective peer support leaders among the Clementeens. They also play a key role in integrating our Secondary 1 Clementeens into a new school environment through the Peer Support Programme.

**VALUES-IN-ACTION**

The VIA Programme aims to nurture future-ready Clementeens with a heart to serve the community. The progression of VIA projects from lower to upper Secondary develops in Clementeens good knowledge of the needs of the school and the community, and also equips them with the requisite social-emotional competencies as they work in teams for the greater good of the community.   

**SECONDARY ONE VIA**

At Secondary 1, students participate in Project Clean-My-School to clean up CTSS compounds. Through four sessions of experiential learning, Clementeens develop empathy for the hard work that our school cleaners put in daily to provide a conducive environment for everyone.

**SECONDARY TWO VIA**

At Secondary 2, students engage in VIA that impacts the environment of the Clementi community. They are involved in a recycling outreach programme to publicize and collect recyclables from residents living in Clementi neighbourhood. The funds raised from the recyclables collection go towards a beneficiary of the cohort’s choice. 

**UPPER SECONDARY VIA**

At Upper Secondary levels, students self-initiate their own VIA project with facilitation by teachers. The programme not only strives to encourage an active student voice but also to engage Clementeens in meaningful service to the school and communities through careful integration with established service and learning objectives. Through this VIA, Clementeens also learn project-management skills as they work effectively in teams to come up with innovative ideas to collectively play an active role in bettering the lives of others.
