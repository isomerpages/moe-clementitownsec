At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021.  
  
Clementi Town Secondary School embraces the use of Information and Communications Technology ICT (ICT) as a key enabler in designing and implement meaningful learning experiences for our students, aligned with our school's ICT mission of _Developing Every Clementeen into Future-ready, Digital Learners_.

FINDINGS FROM NDLP PILOT
------------------------

  
From 1 February to 26 February 2021, two Secondary 3 classes were selected to participate in the NDLP Pilot Programme. The objectives of this pilot were to:  

1.  assess suitability of a tablet device and a traditional clam-shell computing device for NDLP;
2.  allow a group of our teachers to experience how their T&L might shift with NDLP, involve them and get their input; and
3.  discover possible implementation challenges which we might not have anticipated, and to then adjust our plans.

  
Students from one of the of the classes were issued with a tablet device (iPad), while students from the other class were issued a traditional clam-shell computing device.  
  
**Findings from Students**  

Students involved in the pilot had an overall positive experience. The devices issued to them gave them an opportunity to be more participative during lessons, and gave them control of their learning pace and path. Most students preferred the use of the PLD, especially the iPads, over their own mobile phones as the larger screen, keyboard and stylus afforded clearer presentation of information, ease of access to learning materials, collaboration with peers in class and note-taking during lessons.  
  
Let's watch the following video to hear from our students about their experiences using their PLDs as part of lessons.
