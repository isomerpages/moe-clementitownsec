<u>AI Bootcamp</u>  
  
A 5-day Artificial Intelligence (AI) Bootcamp was organised during the June Holidays to:  
provide Clementeens, who have demonstrated an interest and passion for programming, the opportunity to develop deep technology skills for the emergent fields of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.  
further inspire and ignite our Clementeens' passion for Technology through application of these skills in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.  
  
At the end of the bootcamp, participants created their own projects. Please click on the image below to find out more about one of the AI projects that was created upon completion of the bootcamp.
