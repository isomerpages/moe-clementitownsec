The CT Musical journey began in 2009, with the Literature classâ€™ wish to present on stage the text they had felt strongly for, To Kill a Mockingbird. The ground-up production saw the devotion of both alumni and then-current students, and the show was staged in the school hall after four months of preparation. The journey had taught the students strong lessons of empathy, respect and love, and reinforced the school values of adaptability and self-discipline. Recognising the power of drama to train the soft skills and adversity quotient required to help our students navigate their way about the VUCA world and having witnessed the strong bonds built between alumni and current students with the production, the school began the CT musical tradition, and we have put up five musicals that are open to all students to audition, since our first.
